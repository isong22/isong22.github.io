******   hSong VERSION -- July 27 2022 ******

8-3-5 - all stylesheet hrefs should now be to hSong.css

8-5-22 - removed Decompose dir - some html files have many songs, these need to be decomposed into the separate songs
	- also removed odd XATTRS from all files/dirs: xattr -cr is recursive

then Lists has Setlits linked back to Songs/Tunes
and Lists-ALL by Band (i.e. Collies_

html - is for templates
images - is for jpegs/gifs not in tunes-dir

bin - scripts 
    - need a re-indexer so AllSongs.html has em all in Alphabetic order
	as well as all_collies.html, all_dakota.html get updated
    - reindexer will have to know what band a song belongs to, SQLITE ?
