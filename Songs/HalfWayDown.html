  Halfway Down
 </h3>
 Raindrops on the treetops
 <br/>
 Waiting there to fall
 <br/>
 I know how they're feeling
 <br/>
 But I'm only, yes I'm only, halfway down
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Fighting with the devil
 <br/>
 Harder all the time
 <br/>
 Sinkin' to his level
 <br/>
 But I'm only, yes I'm only, halfway down
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Halfway down, just a getting started
 <br/>
 Yes I'm beginning on my journey now
 <br/>
 But I've only gotten halfway down
 <br/>
 Halfway down, just a little bit farther
 <br/>
 Well I believe you better catch me now
 <br/>
 'Cause I'm only going halfway down
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sippin' shallow water
 <br/>
 Sharks out for the kill
 <br/>
 Almost hittin' bottom
 <br/>
 But I'm only, yes I'm only, halfway down
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Halfway down, just a getting started
 <br/>
 Yes I'm beginning on my journey now
 <br/>
 But I've only gotten halfway down
 <br/>
 Halfway down, just a little bit farther
 <br/>
 Well I believe you better catch me now
 <br/>
 'Cause I'm only going halfway down
 <br/>
 Yeah I hope you better catch me now
 <br/>
 'Cause I'm only going halfway down
 <br/>
 Yes I'm only going halfway down
 <br/>
 Yes I'm only going halfway down
 <br/>
