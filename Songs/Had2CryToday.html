<p class='verse'>It's already written that, today will be one to remember
<br/>The feeling's the same as, being outside of the law
<br/>Had to cry today
<br/>Well I saw your sign and I missed you there
<p>
<p class='verse'>I'm taking the chance, to see the wind in your eyes, while I listen
<br/> You say you can't reach me but you, want everyone to be free
<br/>Had to cry today
<br/>Well I saw your sign and I missed you there
<p>
