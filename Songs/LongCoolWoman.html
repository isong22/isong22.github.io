<h2>Long Cool Woman  </h2><div id="lyrics-body">
 <p class="verse">
Saturday night I was down town, Working for the F.B.I.<br />
Sitting in a nest of bad men, Whiskey bottles piling high<br />
Boot legging boozer on the west side, Full of people who are doing wrong<br />
Just about to call up the D.A. man, When I heard this woman singing a song.<br />
<br />
A pair of forty fives made me open my eyes<br />
My temperature started to rise<br />
  <br/>
She was a long cool woman in a black dress<br />
Just a 5-9, Beautiful, Tall<br />
With just one look I was a bad mess<br />
Cause that long cool woman had it all.<br />
 <p class="verse">
Saw her heading to the table, Well a tall walking big black cat<br />
When Charlie said "I hope that you're able Boy"<br />
Well I'm telling you she knows where it's at<br />
Well suddenly we heard a siren, And every body started to run<br />
A jumping out of doors and tables, Well I heard somebody shooting a gun.<br />
<br />
Well the D.A. was pumping my left hand<br />
And a she a holding my right<br />
And I told her don't get scared, Cause you're gonna be spared<br />
I gotta be forgiven, If I want to starta living with a<br />
