<h2>The Harder They Come</h2><div id="lyrics-body">
 <p class="verse">
  Well, they tell me of a pie up in the sky
  <br/>
  Waiting for me when I die
  <br/>
  But
between the day you're born and when you die
  <br/>
  You know, they never
seem to hear even your cry
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Chorus: 
But as sure as the sun will shine
  <br/>
  I'm gonna get my share now what is
mine
  <br/>
  And then the harder they come, The harder they fall
  <br/>
  One
and all
  <br/>
  The harder they come. The harder they fall, One and all
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  And the oppressors are trying to track me down
  <br/>
  They're trying to drive
me underground
  <br/>
  And they think that they have got the battle won
  <br/>
  I
say, forgive them Lord, they know not what they've done
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Chorus:
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  And I keep on fighting for the things I want
  <br/>
  Though I know that when
you're dead you can't
  <br/>
  But I'd rather be a free man in my
grave
  <br/>
  Than living as a puppet or a slave
 </p>
