</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p1">A miner's life is like a sailor on board a ship to cross the waves<br>
Every day his life's in danger, many ventures being brave<br>
Watch the rocks, they're falling daily, careless miners always fail<br>
Keep your hand upon your wages and your eye upon the scale</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Chorus:<br>
Union miners, stand together<br>
Do not heed, the Coal Board's tale<br>
Keep your hand, upon your wages<br>
And your eye upon, the scale</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">You've been docked and docked again, boys, you've been loading three for one<br>
What's the use in all your working when your mining days are done?<br>
Worn out shoes and worn miners, blackened lungs and faces pale<br>
Oh keep your hand upon your wages and your eye upon the scale</p>
<p class="p1">(Chorus)</p>
<p class="p1">In conclusion, bear in memory, keep this password in your mind<br>
Worker's strength cannot be broken when unions be combined<br>
Stand up tall and stand together, victory for you prevail<br>
Oh keep your hands upon your wages and your eye upon the scale</p>
<p class="p1">(Chorus twice)</p>
