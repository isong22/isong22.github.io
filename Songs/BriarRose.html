<p class="p1">Briar and the Rose</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">I fell asleep down by the stream<br>
And there I had the strangest dream<br>
And down by Brennan's Glenn there grows<br>
A briar and a rose</p>
<p class="p3">There's a tree in the forest<br>
But I don't know where<br>
I built a nest out of your hair<br>
And climbing up into the air<br>
A briar and a rose</p>
<p class="p3">I don't know how long it has been<br>
But I was born in Brennan's Glenn<br>
And near the end of spring there grows<br>
A briar and a rose</p>
<p class="p3">I Picked the rose, one early morn<br>
I pricked my finger, on a thorn<br>
It had grown so high, It's winding wove <br>
the briar around the rose</p>
<p class="p3">I tried to tear them both apart<br>
I felt a bullet in my heart<br>
And all dressed up in springâ€™s new clothes<br>
The briar and the rose</p>
<p class="p3">And when I'm buried in my grave<br>
Tell me so I will know<br>
Your tears will fall, To make love grow<br>
The briar and the rose</p>
