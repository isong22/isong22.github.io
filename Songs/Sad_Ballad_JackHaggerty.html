</font><font face="Palatino">
<p>My name is Jack Haggerty, from Greenville I come,</p>
<p>All pleasures departed, from all joys I disdain;</p>
<p>From the strong darts of Cupid, that gave me such grief,</p>
<p>Till my heart breaks asunder I shall ne’er get relief.</p>
<p><br>
My calling is rafting, where the Flat river rolls,</p>
<p>My name is engraved on its and rocks and sand shoals,</p>
<p>Through shops, bars and households, it’s very well known,</p>
<p>They call me Jack Haggerty, the pride of the town.</p>
<p><br>
I will tell you my troubles without more delay,</p>
<p>How a sweet little lassie my heart stole away.</p>
<p>She was a ‘smith’s daughter, on the Flat river side,</p>
<p>And I always intended to make her my bride.</p>
<p><br>
Her form like the dove was most slender and neat,</p>
<p>And her hair hung in ringlets to her tiny white feet,</p>
<p>Her voice was a clear as the nightingale’s song,</p>
<p>And it rang in my ears all the day and night long.</p>
<p>I dressed her in muslin, in silk, and in lace,</p>
<p>In the costliest of jewels her hands I incased,</p>
<p>I gave her my wages each month to keep safe,</p>
<p>I begrudged her of nothing I had on the earth.</p>
<p>I took her to suppers, to parties, and balls,</p>
<p>On Sunday boat riding was the first early call,</p>
<p>She said that she loved me as we strolled through the town,</p>
<p>Her words were sweet as music ‘ere the rise of the morn.</p>
<p><br>
I worked on the river, I earned quite a stake,</p>
<p>I was steadfast and steady, I ne’er played the rake,</p>
<p>I was bouyant and happy, on the boiling, white stream,</p>
<p>My thoughts were of Anna—she haunted my dreams.</p>
<p>One day on the river a letter I received,</p>
<p>She said from her promise herself would relieve,</p>
<p>That the marriage to a loved one she had long time delayed,</p>
<p>And the next time I saw her she would ne’er be a maid.</p>
<p>Her mother, Jane Tucker, was the one most to blame,</p>
<p>She caused her to leave me, and blacken my name,</p>
<p>She cast off the rigging that God would soon tie,</p>
<p>And left me to wander, ‘til the day that I die.</p>
<p>Farewell to flat River, for me there’s no rest,</p>
<p>I’ll shoulder my peevie and I will go west;</p>
<p>I’ll go to Montana, some comfort to fine,</p>
<p>And leave both Flat river and Anna behind.</p>
<p>Now all you bold raftsmen, kind-hearted and true,</p>
<p>Don’t rely on a woman—you’re beat if you do;</p>
<p>And if ever you meet one with brown chestnut curls,</p>
<p>Just think of Jack Haggerty and the Flat River girl.</p>
