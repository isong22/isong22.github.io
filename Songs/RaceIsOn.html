<h2>The Race Is On</h2>
<div id="lyrics-body">
 <p class="verse">
I feel tears welling up from down deep inside,<br>
Like my heart's got a big break<br>
And a stab of loneliness sharp and painful that I may never shake.<br>
You might think that I'm taking it hard since you broke me off with a call,<br>
You might wager that I'll hide in sorrow and I might lay right down and bawl.<br>
 <p class="verse">
  <br/>
Now the race is on and here comes pride up the back stretch,<br>
Heartaches a goin' to the inside, my tears are holding back, tryin' not to fall.<br>
My heart's our of the running, true love scratched for another's sake,<br>
The race is on and it looks like heartaches, and the winner loses all.<br>
 <p class="verse">
  <br/>
One day I ventured in love never once suspecting<br>
What the final result would be.<br>
Now I live in fear of waking up each morning,<br>
And finding that you're gone from me.<br>
There's an aching pain in my heart for the name of the one that I hated to face,<br>
Someone else came out to win her, and I came out in second place<br>
 <p class="verse">
Chorus:<br>
