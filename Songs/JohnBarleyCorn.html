<h2>John Barleycorn - em </h2> </a>
<div class="lyrics-body">
<p class='verse'>
There were three men came out of the West, Their fortunes for to try<br />
And these three men made a solemn vow, John Barleycorn must die<br />
They've ploughed, they've sewn, they've harrowed him in, Threw clods upon his head<br />
And these three men made a solemn vow, John Barleycorn was dead<br />
</p>
<p class='verse'>
They've let him lie for a very long time Till the rains from heaven did fall<br />
And little Sir John sprung up his head, And so amazed them all<br />
They've let him stand till midsummer's day, Till he looked both pale and wan<br />
And little Sir John's grown a long, long beard, And so become a man<br />
</p>
<p class='verse'>
They've hired men with the scythes so sharp, To cut him off at the knee<br />
They've rolled him and tied him by the way, Serving him most barbarously<br />
They've hired men with the sharp pitchforks, Who pricked him to the heart<br />
And the loader he has served him worse than that, For he's bound him to the cart<br />
</p>
<p class='verse'>
They've wheeled him around and around the field, Till they came unto a barn<br />
And there they made a solemn oath, On poor John Barleycorn<br />
They've hired men with the crab-tree sticks, To cut him skin from bone<br />
And the miller he has served him worse than that, For he's ground him between two stones<br />
</p>
<p class='verse'>
And little Sir John and the nut-brown bowl, And he's brandy in the glass<br />
And little Sir John and the nut-brown bowl, Proved the strongest man at last<br />
The huntsman, he can't hunt the fox, Nor so loudly to blow his horn<br />
And the tinker he can't mend kettle nor pot, Without a little Barleycorn<br />
