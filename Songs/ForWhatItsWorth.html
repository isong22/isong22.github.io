<h2>For What It's Worth</h2><div id="lyrics-body">
 <p class="verse">
  There's something happening here
  <br/>
  And what it is ain't exactly clear
  <br/>
  There's a man with a gun over Telling me that I've got to beware
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CHORUS #1
  <br/>
  I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound
  <br/>
  A C (D) E E A E A
  <br/>
  Everybody look whats goin' down
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There's battle lines being drawn
  <br/>
  And nobody's right, if everybody's wrong
  <br/>
  Young people speaking their minds
  <br/>
  Getting so much resistance from behind ...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CHORUS
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What a field day for the heat ooooh
  <br/>
  A thousand people in the street ooooh
  <br/>
  Singin' songs, and carryin' signs ooooh
  <br/>
  Mostly say "hooray for our side" ooooh ...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CHORUS #2
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paranoia strikes deep
  <br/>
  Into your life it will creep
  <br/>
  It starts when you're always afraid
  <br/>
  Step outta line, the men come, and take you away
  <br/>
