<p class="p1">Whiskey In The Jar - Trad</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">As I was going over the far famed Kerry mountains<br>
I met with captain Farrell and his money he was counting. <br>
I first produced my pistol, and then produced my rapier.<br>
Said stand and deliver, for I am a bold deceiver,</p>
<p class="p3">musha ring dumma do damma da <br>
whack for the daddy 'ol<br>
whack for the daddy 'ol<br>
there's whiskey in the jar</p>
<p class="p3">I counted out his money, and it made a pretty penny.<br>
I put it in my pocket and I took it home to Jenny.<br>
She said and she swore, that she never would deceive me,<br>
but the devil take the women, for they never can be easy</p>
<p class="p3">I went into my chamber, all for to take a slumber,<br>
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure it was no wonder.<br>
But Jenny took my charges and she filled them up with water,<br>
Then sent for captain Farrel to be ready for the slaughter.</p>
<p class="p3">It was early in the morning, as I rose up for travel,<br>
The guards were all around me and likewise captain Farrel.<br>
I first produced my pistol, for she stole away my rapier,<br>
But I couldn't shoot the water so a prisoner I was taken.</p>
<p class="p3">If anyone can aid me, it's my brother in the army,<br>
If I can find his station down in Cork or in Killarney.<br>
And if he'll come and save me, we'll go roving near Kilkenny,<br>
And I swear he'll treat me better than me darling sportling Jenny</p>
<p class="p3">Now some men take delight in the drinking and the roving,<br>
But others take delight in the gambling and the smoking.<br>
But I take delight in the juice of the barley,<br>
And courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early</p>
