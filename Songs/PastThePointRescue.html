<p class="p2">
Last night I dreamed, you were back again,
<br>Larger than life again, holding me tight again
<br>Placing those same kisses on my brow,
<br>Sweeter than ever now, lord I remember how
<br>Couldn't get enough of kissing, do you know how much you're missing ?
<br>No you don't, but I do (A) ..
<br>
<br>Days like a slow train trickle by, Even the words that I write, refuse to fly
<br>All I can hear is your song haunting me
<br>Can't get the melody, out of my head you see
<br>Distractions I've been using, do you know how much you're losing ?
<br>No you don't, but I do (A) 
</p>
<br>
<p class="p1">chorus:</p>
<p class="p2">
but I do (G)...
<br>And I wonder if I'm past the point of rescue ?
<br>Is no word from you at all the best that you can do ?
<br>I never meant to push or shove you, do you know how much I love you ?
<br>No you don't, but I do...<span class="s3">A em em</span>

<p class="p2"><span class="s3">instr verse</span></p>
<p class="p2">
<br>I swore I'd never fall like this again
<br>Fools like me never win, came to my knees again
<br>Can't close the door on the likelihood
<br>Things might be just as good, I always believed they would
<br>Gotta let your love invite me, baby do you think it might be
<br>No you don't, but I do  .. but I do ...
