<h3>Spill The Wine</h3>
<div class="lyrics-body">
<b>Gtr/Harm - clean 2</b>
<p class='verse'>I was once out strolling one very hot summer's day<br>
When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest<br>
In a big field of tall grass<br>
I laid there in the sun and felt it caressing my face<br>
As I fell asleep and dreamed<br>
I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie<br>
And that I was the star of the movie<br>
This really blew my mind<br>
The fact that me an overfed long haired leaping gnome<br>
Should be the star of a Hollywood movie, hmmm<br>
But there I was<br>
Hmm, I was taken to a place<br>
The hall of the mountain kings<br>
I stood high by the mountain tops<br>
Naked to the world<br>
In front of<br>
Every kind of girl<br>
There was long one's, tall ones, short ones, brown ones<br>
Black ones, round ones, big ones, crazy ones<br>
Out of the middle, came a lady<br>
She whispered in my ear<br>
Something crazy<br>
She said,</p><p class='verse'>Spill the wine, take that pearl<br>
Spill the wine, take that pearl<br>
Spill the wine, take that pearl<br>
Spill the wine, take that pearl</p><p class='verse'>I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back<br>
As she disappeared, but soon she returned<br>
In her hand was a bottle of wine<br>
In the other a glass<br>
She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass<br>
And raised it to her lips<br>
And just before she drank it, she said</p><p class='verse'>Take the wine dig that girl<br>
Spill the wine, dig that girl<br>
Spill the wine, dig that girl, come on, come on<br>
Spill the wine, dig that girl<br>
Take that girl, yeah<br>
It's on girl, all you gotta do is spill that wine<br>
Spill that wine, let me feel, let me feel hot, yeah, yeah, ooh<br>
Spill the wine, spill the wine, spill the wine, spill the wine<br>
Spill the wine, spill the wine, spill the wine<br>
Dig that girl</p>	</div>
