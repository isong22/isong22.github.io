<h2>Ramblin' Fever Lyrics - Merle Haggard - G</h2><div class="lyrics-body">
 My hat don't hang on the same nail too long
 <br/>
 My ears can't stand to hear the same old song
 <br/>
 And I don't leave the highway long enough
 <br/>
 To bog down in the mud
 <br/>
 'Cause I've got ramblin' fever in my blood
 <br/>
 <br/>
 I caught this ramblin' fever long ago
 <br/>
 When I first heard a lonesome whistle blow
 <br/>
 If someone said I ever gave a damn, They damn sure told you wrong
 <br/>
 I've had ramblin' fever all along
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ramblin' fever, the kind that can't be measured by degrees
 <br/>
 Ramblin' fever, there ain't no kind of cure for my disease
 <br/>
 <br/>
 There's times I'd like to bed down on a sofa
 <br/>
 And let some pretty lady rub my back
 <br/>
 And spend the early morning drinking coffee
 <br/>
 And talking about when I'll be coming back
 <br/>
 <br/>
 'Cause I don't let know no woman tie me down
 <br/>
 And I'll never get too old to get around
 <br/>
 I'm gonna die along the highway and rot away
 <br/>
 Like some old high-line pole,
 <br/>
 Rest this ramblin' fever in my soul
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ramblin' fever, the kind that can't be measured by degrees
 <br/>
 Ramblin' fever, there ain't no kind of cure for my disease
