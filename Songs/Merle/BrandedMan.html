<h2>Branded Man Lyrics - Merle Haggard - G</h2><div class="lyrics-body">
 I'd like to hold my head up and be proud of who I am
 <br/>
 But they won't let my secret go untold
 <br/>
 I paid the debt I owed them,but they're still not satisfied
 <br/>
 Now I'm a branded man out in the cold
 <br/>
 <br/>
 When they let me out of prison,I held my head up high
 <br/>
 Determined I would rise above the shame
 <br/>
 But no matter where I'm living,the black mark follows me
 <br/>
 I'm branded with a number on my name
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chorus:
 <br/>
 I'd like to hold my head up and be proud of who I am
 <br/>
 But they won't let my secret go untold
 <br/>
 I paid the debt I owed them,but they're still not satisfied
 <br/>
 Now I'm a branded man out in the cold
 <br/>
 <br/>
 If I live to be a hundred,I guess I'll never clear my name
 <br/>
 'Cause everybody knows I've been in jai
 <br/>
 No matter where I'm living,I've got to tell them where I've been
 <br/>
 Or they'll send me back to prison if I fail
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chorus:
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Now I'm a branded man out in the cold
