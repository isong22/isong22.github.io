<h2> If I Could Only Fly - Blaze Foley - D? </h2><div class="lyrics-body">
 <p class="verse">
  I almost felt you touching me just now
  <br/>
  I wish I knew which way to turn and go
  <br/>
  I feel so good and then, then I feel so bad
  <br/>
  I wonder what I ought to do
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  If I could only fly, if I could only fly
  <br/>
  I'd bid this place goodbye
  <br/>
  to come and be with you
  <br/>
  But I can hardly stand and I got no where to run
  <br/>
  Another sinking sun
  <br/>
  and one more lonely night
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  The wind keeps blowing somewhere, everyday
  <br/>
  Tell me things get better somewhere, up the way
  <br/>
  Just dismal thinking, on a dismal day
  <br/>
  And sad songs, for us to bare
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  If I could only fly, If we could only fly
  <br/>
  If we could only fly, There'd be no more lonely nights
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Instr
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  You know, sometimes, I write happy songs
  <br/>
  Then some little thing goes wrong
  <br/>
  I wish they all could make you smile
  <br/>
  Coming home soon, and I wanna stay
  <br/>
  Maybe we can, somehow, get away
  <br/>
  I wish you could come with me, when I go again
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  If I could only fly, if I could only fly
  <br/>
  I'd bid this place goodbye to come and be with you
  <br/>
  But I can hardly stand and I got no where to run
  <br/>
  Another sinking sun and one more lonely night
