<h2>Thats The Way Love Goes - E </h2><div class="lyrics-body">
 I've been throwing horseshoes, Over my left shoulder
 <br/>
 I've spent most all my life, Searching for that four-leafed clover
 <br/>
 Yet you ran with me, Chasing my rainbows
 <br/>
 And honey I love you, too (and) That's the way love goes.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 That's the way love goes, babe, That's the music God made
 <br/>
 For all the world to sing, It's never old; it grows
 <br/>
 Losing makes me sorry, Well now, "Honey, don't worry."
 <br/>
 Don't you know I love you too, That's the way love goes.
