<h2>If We Make It Through December</h2><div class="lyrics-body">
 <p class="verse">
  If we make it through December
  <br/>
  Everything's gonna be all right, I know
  <br/>
  It's the coldest time of winter
  <br/>
  And I shiver when I see the falling snow
  <br/>
  If we make it through December
  <br/>
  Got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime
  <br/>
  Maybe even California
  <br/>
  If we make it through December, we'll be fine
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Got laid off down at the factory
  <br/>
  And their timing's not the greatest in the world
  <br/>
  Heaven knows I been working hard
  <br/>
  Wanted Christmas to be right for daddy's girl
  <br/>
  I don't mean to hate December
  <br/>
  It's meant to be the happy time of year
  <br/>
  And my little girl don't understand
  <br/>
  Why daddy can't afford no Christmas here
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  If we make it thru December .....
  <br/>
  .....
  <br/>
  If we make it through December, we'll be fine
