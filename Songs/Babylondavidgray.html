<h2>Babylon - david gray</h2><div id="lyrics-body">
 <p class="verse">
  Friday night,  I'm going nowhere
  <br>
   All the lights are changing green to red
   <br>
    Turning over TV stations, Situations running through my head
    <br>
     Well looking back through time, You know it's clear that I've been blind - I've been a fool
     <br>
      To open up my heart, To all that jealousy,
      <br>
       That bitterness, That ridicule
      </br>
     </br>
    </br>
   </br>
  </br>
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Saturday I'm running wild, And all the lights are changing red to green
  <br>
   Moving through the crowd I'm pushing, Chemicals all rushing through my bloodstream
   <br>
    Only wish that you were here, You know I'm seeing it so clear, I've been afraid
    <br>
     To show you how I really feel, Admit to some of those bad mistakes I've made
    </br>
   </br>
  </br>
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  <b>
   Chorus
  </b>
  <br>
   If you want it, Come and get it - Crying out loud
   <br>
    The love that I was, Giving you was, Never in doubt
    <br>
     Let go your heart - Let go your head - And feel it now
     <br>
      Babylon, Babylon
     </br>
    </br>
   </br>
  </br>
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Sunday all the lights of London, Shining sky is fading red to blue
  <br>
   I'm kicking through the autumn leaves, And wondering where it is you might be going to
   <br>
    Turning back for home, You know I'm feeling so alone, I can't believe
    <br>
     Climbing on the stair, I turn around to see you smiling there, In front of me
    </br>
   </br>
  </br>
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Chorus
  </b>
  Let go your heart
  <br>
   Let go your head
   <br/>
   And feel it now
   <br>
    Babylon, Babylon, Babylon
