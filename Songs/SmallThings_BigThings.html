<h2>Small Things - Big Things  - D</h2><div id="lyrics-body">
 <p class="verse">
At sixteen she quit high school to make her fortune in the promised land<br>
She got a job behind the counter in an all-night hamburger stand<br>
She wrote faithfully home to mama, "Now mama, don't you worry none<br>
From small things, mama, big things one day come"<br>
 <p class="verse">
It was late one Friday, he pulled in out of the dark<br>
He was tall and handsome, first she took his order then she took his heart<br>
They bought a house up on the hillside where little feet would soon run<br>
From small things, mama, big things one day come<br>
 <p class="verse">

Oh, but love was fleeting, It's sad but it's true<br>
When your heart is beating, You don't want to hear the news<br>
 <p class="verse">
She packed her bags and with a Wyomie County real state man<br>
She drove down to Tampa in an Eldorado Grand<br>
She wrote back, "Dear mama, life is just heaven in the sun<br>
From small things, mama, big things one day come"<br>
 <p class="verse">

<b>bridge 2></b><br />
Well, she shot him dead, On a sunny Florida road<br>
When they caught her all she said, Was she couldn't stand the way he drove<br>
 <p class="verse">
Back home, lonesome Johnny waits for his baby's parole<br>
He waits high on the hillside where the Wyomie rivers roll<br>
At his feet and almost grown now, a blue-eyed daughter and a handsome son<br>
From small things, mama, big things one day come<br>
From small things, mama, big things one day come<br>
Well, from small things, mama, big things one day come<br>
<br> <b>Breakdown - Key Change ! vamp 4-1-4-1 </b>
From small things, mama, big things one day come<br>
From small things, mama, big things one day come<br>
Yeah, from small things, mama, big things one day come<br>
