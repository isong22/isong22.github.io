<h2> One More Saturday Night</h2>
<div id="lyrics-body">
<p class="verse">
I went down to the mountain, I was drinkin some wine <br/>
Looked up in the heavens, Lord,  I saw a mighty sign <br/>
(written) FIRE across the heavens, plain as back and white <br/>
Get prepared, there?s gonna be a party tonight.
</p>
<p class="verse"> Chorus --- <br/>
Uhuh, Hey! Saturday Night! <br/>
Yeh, uhuh one more Saturday night, <br/>
Hey Saturday night!
</p>
<p class="verse">
Everybody?s dancin? down the local armory <br/>
With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery. <br/>
The temperature keeps risin?, everybody gittin? high; <br/>
Come the rockin? stroke of midnite, the whole place gonna fly. <br/>
Chorus ..
</p>
<p class="verse">
Turn on channel six, the President comes on the news, <br/>
Says, ?I get no satisfaction, that?s why I sing the blues.? <br/>
His wife say ?Don?t get crazy, Lord, you know just what to do, <br/>
Crank up that old Victrola, put on them rockin? shoes.? <br/>
Chorus ..
</p>
<p class="verse">
Then God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth, <br/>
Thought He?d have a big old party, thought He?d call it planet Earth. <br/>
Don?t worry about tomorrow, Lord, you?ll know it when it comes, <br/>
When the rock and roll music meets the risin? sun. <br/>
