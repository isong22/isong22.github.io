<div id="lyrics-body">
<p class="verse">
I told Althea I was feeling lost <br/>
Lacking in some direction <br/>
Althea told me upon scrutiny <br/>
my back might need protection <br/>
<br/> 
I told Althea that treachery <br/>
was tearin me limb from limb <br/>
Althea told me: now cool down boy - <br/>
settle back easy Jim <br/>
<br/> 
You may be Saturday's child all grown <br/>
moving with a pinch of grace <br/>
You may be a clown in the burying ground <br/>
or just another pretty face <br/>
You may be the fate of Ophelia <br/>
sleeping and perchance to dream - <br/>
honest to the point of recklessness <br/>
self centered to the extreme <br/>
<br/> 
Ain't nobody messin with you but you <br/>
your friends are getting most concerned - <br/>
loose with the truth <br/>
maybe it's your fire <br/>
but baby...don't get burned <br/>
When the smoke has cleared, she said, <br/>
that's what she said to me: <br/>
You're gonna want a bed to lay your head <br/>
and a little sympathy <br/>
<br/> 
There are things you can replace <br/>
and others you cannot <br/>
The time has come to weigh those things <br/>
this space is getting hot - <br/>
you know this space is getting hot <br/>
<br/> 
I told Althea <br/>
I'm a roving sign - <br/>
that I was born to be a bachelor - <br/>
Althea told me: Ok that's fine - <br/>
So now I'm out trying to catch her <br/>
<br/> 
Can't talk to me without talking to you <br/>
We're guilty of the same old thing <br/>
Talking a lot about less and less <br/>
And forgetting the love we bring
