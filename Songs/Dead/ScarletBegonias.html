<h2>Scarlet Begonias </h2>
<div id="lyrics-body">
<p class="verse">
As I was walking round Grovenors Square <br/>
Not a chill to the winter but a nip to the air <br/>
From the other direction, she was calling my eye (note 1) <br/>
It could be an illusion, but I might as well try, Might as well try
</p>
<p class="verse">
She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes <br/>
And I knew without asking she was into the blues <br/>
She wore scarlet begonias, tucked into her curls <br/>
I knew right away, she was not like other girls, Other girls
</p>
<p class="verse">
In the thick of the evening when the dealing got rough (note 2) <br/>
She was too pat to open and too cool to bluff <br/>
As I picked up my matches and was closing the door <br/>
I had one of those flashes I had been there before <br/>
Been there before
</p>
<p class="verse"> 5..... 5..... 5.... Bridge ......<br/>
Well I ain't often right but I've never been wrong <br/>
It seldom turns out the way it does in the song <br/>
Once in a while you get shown the light <br/>
In the strangest of places if you look at it right <br/>
lick #2
</p>
<p class="verse">
Well there ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves (note 3) <br/>
Scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues <br/>
And there's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eyes (note 4) <br/>
I had to learn the hard way, to let her pass by, Let her pass by <br/>
