<h2>Franklin's Tower</h2>
<div id="lyrics-body">
<p class="verse">
In another time's / forgotten space <br/>
Your eyes looked through/ your mother's face <br/>
Wildflower seed / on the sand and stone <br/>
May the four winds blow / you safely home  <br/>
Roll away... the dew x4
</p>
<p class="verse"> Intr - short </p>
<p class="verse">
You ask me where / the four winds dwell <br/>
In Franklin's tower  / there hangs a bell <br/>
It can ring / turn night to day <br/>
Ring like fire / if you lose your way <br/>
Roll away... the dew . . . x 4
</p>
<p class="verse">
God save the child / that rings that bell <br/>
It may have one good ring left / you can't tell <br/>
One watch by night, One watch by day <br/>
If you get confused / (just) listen to the music play
</p>
<p class="verse"> Instr verse+chorus </p>
<p class="verse">
Some come to laugh / their past away <br/>
Some come to make it / just one more day <br/>
Whichever way / your pleasure tends <br/>
If you plant ice / you?re gonna harvest wind <br/>
Roll away ... the dew...x4  </p>
<p class="verse"> Instr #2 </p>
<p class="verse">
In Franklin's Tower / the four winds sleep <br/>
Like four lean hounds / the lighthouse keep <br/>
Wildflower seed / in the sand and wind <br/>
May the four winds blow / you home again <br/>
Roll away ... the dew...x4 <br/>
</p>
