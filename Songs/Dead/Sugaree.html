<p class="verse">
    When they come to take you down<br>
    When they bring that wagon round<br>
    When they come to call on you<br>
    and drag your poor body down<br>
<p class="verse">
    Just one thing I ask of you<br>
    Just one thing for me<br>
    Please forget you knew my name<br>
    My darlin Sugaree<br>
<p class="verse">
Chorus<br>
    Shake it, shake it Sugaree<br>
    Just don't tell them that you know me<br>
<p class="verse">
    You thought you was the cool fool<br>
    Never could do no wrong<br>
    Had everything sewed up tight<br>
    How come you lay awake all night long?<br>
<p class="verse">
    Just one thing I ask of you<br>
    Just one thing for me<br>
    Please forget you knew my name<br>
    My darlin Sugaree<br>
<p class="verse">
    Chorus
<p class="verse">
    You know in spite of all you gained<br>
    you still have to stand out in the pouring rain<br>
    One last voice is calling you<br>
    and I guess it's time you go<br>
<p class="verse">
    Just one thing I ask of you<br>
    Just one thing for me<br>
    Please forget you knew my name<br>
    My darlin Sugaree<br>
<p class="verse">
    Chorus
<p class="verse">
    Shake it up now, Sugaree<br>
    I'll meet you at the Jubilee<br>
    If that Jubilee don't come<br>
    Maybe I'll meet you on the run<br>
<p class="verse">
    One thing I ask of you<br>
    Just one thing for me<br>
    Please forget you knew my name<br>
    my darling Sugaree<br>
<p class="verse">
    Chorus
