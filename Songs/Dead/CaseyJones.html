Lyrics By: Robert Hunter
Music By: Jerry Garcia

<p class="verse">
Driving that train, high on cocaine<br>
Casey Jones you'd better watch your speed<br>
Trouble ahead, trouble behind<br>
And you know that notion just crossed my mind (note 1)<br>

<p class="verse">
This old engine makes it on time<br>
Leaves Central Station 'bout a quarter to nine<br>
Hits River Junction at seventeen to<br>
At a quarter to ten you know it's travelling again<br>

<p class="verse">
Trouble ahead, the lady in red<br>
Take my advice you'd be better off dead<br>
Switchman's sleeping, train Hundred and Two<br>
Is on the wrong track and headed for you<br>

<p class="verse">
Trouble with you is the trouble with me<br>
Got two good eyes but we still don't see<br>
Come round the bend, you know it's the end<br>
The fireman screams and the engine just gleams<br>
