<h2>Sugar Magnolia </h2>
<div id="lyrics-body">
<p class="verse">
Sugar Magnolia, blossoms blooming <br/>
Heads all empty and I don't care <br/>
Saw my baby down by the river <br/>
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air
</p>
<p class="verse">
Sweet blossom, come on under the willow <br/>
We can have high times if you'll abide <br/>
We can discover the wonders of nature <br/>
Wading in the rushes down by the riverside
</p>
<p class="verse">Bridge - 4<br/>
She's got everything delightful <br/>
She's got everything I need <br/>
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double <br/>
Pays my ticket when I speed
</p>
<p class="verse">
She comes skimming through rays of violet <br/>
She can wade in a drop of dew <br/>
She don't come and I don't follow <br/>
Waits backstage while I sing to you <br/>
<br/> 
She can dance a Cajun rhythm <br/>
Jump like a Willys in four wheel drive <br/>
She's a summer love in the spring, fall and winter <br/>
She can make me as happy any man alive <br/>
</p>
<p class="verse">
Sugar Magnolia <br/>
Ringing that bluebell <br/>
Caught up in sunlight <br/>
Come on out singing and I'll walk you in the sunshine <br/>
Come on honey, come along with me
</p>
<p class="verse">
She's got everything delightful <br/>
She's got everything I need <br/>
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight <br/>
Lazing in the sunlight, yes indeed
</p>
<p class="verse">
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying <br/>
When the moon is half way down <br/>
Sometimes when the night is dying <br/>
I take me out and I wander around <br/>
I wander round
</p>
<p class="verse"> Sunshine Daydream <br/>
Sunshine daydream <br/>
Walking in the tall trees <br/>
Going where the wind goes <br/>
Blooming like a red rose <br/>
Breathing more freely <br/>
Ride out singing, I'll walk you in the morning sunshine <br/>
Sunshine daydream <br/>
Sunshine daydream <br/>
Walking in the sunshine <br/>
