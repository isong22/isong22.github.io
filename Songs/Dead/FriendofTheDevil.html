<h2>Friend of The Devil</h2>
<div id="lyrics-body">
<p class="verse">
I lit out from Reno I was trailed by twenty hounds <br/>
Didn't get to sleep that night Till the morning came around <br/>
</p>
<p class="verse"> CHORUS <br/>
I set out running but I take my time  <br/>
A friend of the Devil is a friend of mine <br/>
If I get home before daylight I might get some sleep tonight
</p>
<p class="verse">
I ran into the Devil, babe He loaned me twenty bills <br/>
I spent that night in Utah In a cave up in the hills <br/>
CHORUS 
</p>
<p class="verse">
I ran down to the levee But the Devil caught me there <br/>
He took my twenty dollar bill And he vanished in the air <br/>
CHORUS 
</p>
<p class="verse"> Bridge <br/>
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night <br/>
First one's named sweet Anne Marie and she's my heart's delight <br/>
Second one is prison, baby the sheriff's on my trail <br/>
If he catches up with me I'll spend my life in jail
</p>
<p class="verse">
Got a wife in Chino, babe And one in Cherokee  <br/>
First one says she's got my child But it don't look like me <br/>
CHORUS 
</p>
