<h2>Ripple</h2>
<div id="lyrics-body">
<p class="verse">
If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine <br/>
And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung <br/>
Would you hear my voice come through the music <br/>
Would you hold it near as it were your own? <br/>
<br/> 
It's a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken <br/>
Perhaps they're better left unsung <br/>
I don't know, don't really care <br/>
Let there be songs to fill the air <br/>
<br/> 
(Chorus) <br/>
<br/> 
Ripple in still water <br/>
When there is no pebble tossed <br/>
Nor wind to blow <br/>
<br/> 
Reach out your hand if your cup be empty <br/>
If your cup is full may it be again <br/>
Let it be known there is a fountain <br/>
That was not made by the hands of men <br/>
<br/> 
There is a road, no simple highway <br/>
Between the dawn and the dark of night <br/>
And if you go no one may follow <br/>
That path is for your steps alone <br/>
<br/> 
(Chorus) <br/>
<br/> 
You who choose to lead must follow <br/>
But if you fall you fall alone <br/>
If you should stand then who's to guide you? <br/>
If I knew the way I would take you home <br/>
