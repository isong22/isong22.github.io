<p class="verse">
Please don't dominate the rap, jack, if you've got nothing new to say. <br/>
If you please, don't back up the track, this train's got to run today. <br/>
I spent a little time on the mountain, spent a little time on the hill <br/>
I heard some say "Better run away", others say "better stand still". <br/>
Now I don't know, but I been told it's hard to run with the weight of gold, <br/>
Other hand, I have heard it said, it's just as hard with the weight of lead. <br/>

<p class="verse">
Who can deny, who can deny, it's not just a change in style? <br/>
One step down and another begun and I wonder how many miles. <br/>
I spent a little time on the mountain, I spent a little time on the hill <br/>
Things went down, we don't understand, but I think in time we will. <br/>
Now I don't know, but I was told, in the heat of the sun a man died of cold. <br/>
Keep on running or stand and wait, the sun so dark &amp; the hour so late.

One way or another, one way or another, <br/>

You can't overlook the lack, jack, of any other highway to ride. <br/>
It's got no signs or dividing lines and very few rule to guide. <br/>
I spent a little time on the mountain, spent a little time on the hill <br/>
I saw things getting out of hand, I guess they always will. <br/>
I don't know but I been told If the horse don't pull you got to carry the load. <br/>
I don't know whose back's that strong, maybe find out before too long.
