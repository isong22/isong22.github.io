<h2>Shakedown Street </h2>
<div id="lyrics-body">
<p class="verse">
You tell me this town ain't got no heart <br/>
(Well, well, well - you can never tell) <br/>
The sunny side of the street is dark <br/>
(Well, well, well - You can never tell) <br/>
Maybe that's 'cause it's midnight <br/>
and the dark of the moon besides, or <br/>
maybe the dark is in your eyes (3x) <br/>
You know you got such dark eyes <br/>
<br/> 
(Chorus) <br/>
Nothin shakin on Shakedown street <br/>
used to be the heart of town <br/>
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart <br/>
You just gotta poke around <br/>
<br/> 
You say you've seen this town clear through <br/>
(Well, well, well - you can never tell) <br/>
Nothin here that could interest you <br/>
(Well, well, well - you can never tell) <br/>
It's not because you missed out <br/>
on the thing we had to start <br/>
Maybe you had to much to fast (3x) <br/>
and just overplayed your part <br/>
<br/> 
(Chorus) <br/>
Since I'm, passing your way today <br/>
(Well, well, well - You can never tell) <br/>
I just stopped in cause I want to say <br/>
(Well, well, well - You can never tell) <br/>
I recall your darkness <br/>
when it crackled like a thundercloud <br/>
don't tell me this town ain't got no heart (3x) <br/>
when I can hear it beat out loud <br/>
<br/> 
(Chorus) <br/>
