<h2>Bertha</h2>
<div id="lyrics-body">
<p class="verse">
I had a hard run, Running from your window <br/>
I was all night running, I?m wondering if you care?  <br/>
I had a run-in, Run around in a run down <br/>
Run around the corner, I Run smack into a tree
</p>
<p class="verse"> CHORUS <br/>
I had to move, really had to move <br/>
That's why if you please, I am on my bended knees <br/>
Bertha don't you come around here, anymore
</p>
<p class="verse">
Dressed myself in green, I went down to the sea <br/>
Try to see what's going down, tried to read between the lines <br/>
Had a feeling I was falling, falling, I Turned around to see  <br/>
Heard a voice a-calling, Calling back to me <br/>
CHORUS 
</p>
<p class="verse">
Ran into a rainstorm, Ducked into a bar door <br/>
It was all night pouring, pouring rain but not a drop on me  <br/>
Test me, test me, Why don't you arrest me ? <br/>
Throw me in the jailhouse, Until the sun goes down <br/>
Till it go down <br/>
Chorus 
</p>
