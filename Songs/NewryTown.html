<p class="p3">In Newry Town I was bred and born</p>
<p class="p3">In Stephen's Green now I lie in scorn</p>
<p class="p3">I served my time at the saddling trade</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">𝄆 </span>I always was a roving blade <span class="s1">𝄇</span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">At seventeen I took a wife</p>
<p class="p3">And I loved her dear as I loved me life</p>
<p class="p3">To keep her happy both night and day</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">𝄆 </span>I went out robbing on the kings highway <span class="s1">𝄇</span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">I robbed Lord Goldwyn, I do declare,</p>
<p class="p3">And Lady Masnfield , of Grosvenor Square.</p>
<p class="p3">I shut their shutters and bid them goodnight</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">𝄆</span>And I carried the gold home to me heart's delight <span class="s1">𝄇</span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">To Covenant Garden then we did go,</p>
<p class="p3">All for my bride &amp; I , to see the show.</p>
<p class="p3">Lord Fielding's men, they did me pursue,</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">𝄆</span> And I was taken by that curse-ed crew <span class="s1">𝄇</span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">My father cried, “My darling son,”</p>
<p class="p3">My wife she cried, “Oh, I am undone.”</p>
<p class="p3">My mother tore her white locks and cried</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">𝄆</span> “Oh in his cradle, he should have died.” <span class="s1">𝄇</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Six blooming maidens to carry my pall,</p>
<p class="p3">Give them white gloves and bright ribbons all.</p>
<p class="p3">Six highway men, for to carry me</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">𝄆 </span>Og Give them, broadswords and sweet liberty.<span class="s1">𝄇</span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">And when I'm dead and gone to my grave</p>
<p class="p3">A fancy funeral please let me have.</p>
<p class="p3">When in my grave, they will speak the truth,</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">𝄆 </span>There goes a wild and a wicked youth.”<span class="s1">𝄇</span></p>
