  Copperhead Road
(Steve Earle)
Well my name's John Lee Pettimore
  <br/>
  Same as my daddy and his daddy before
  <br/>
  You hardly ever saw Grandaddy down here
  <br/>
  He only came to town about twice a year
  <br/>
  He'd buy a hundred pounds of yeast and some copper line
  <br/>
  Everybody knew that he made moonshine
  <br/>
  Now the revenue man wanted Grandaddy bad
  <br/>
  He headed up the holler with everything he had
  <br/>
  It's before my time but I've been told
  <br/>
  He never came back from Copperhead Road
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now Daddy ran the whiskey in a big block Dodge
  <br/>
  Bought it at an auction at the Mason's Lodge
  <br/>
  Johnson County Sheriff painted on the side
  <br/>
  Just shot a coat of primer then he looked inside
  <br/>
  Well him and my uncle tore that engine down
  <br/>
  I still remember that rumblin' sound
  <br/>
  Well the sheriff came around in the middle of the night
  <br/>
  Heard mama cryin', knew something wasn't right
  <br/>
  He was headed down to Knoxville with the weekly load
  <br/>
  You could smell the whiskey burnin' down Copperhead Road
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I volunteered for the Army on my birthday
  <br/>
  They draft the white trash first,'round here anyway
  <br/>
  I done two tours of duty in Vietnam
  <br/>
  And I came home with a brand new plan
  <br/>
  I take the seed from Colombia and Mexico
  <br/>
  I plant it up the holler down Copperhead Road
  <br/>
  Well the D.E.A.'s got a chopper in the air
  <br/>
  I wake up screaming like I'm back over there
  <br/>
  I learned a thing or two from ol' Charlie don't you know
  <br/>
  You better stay away from Copperhead Road
  <br/>
