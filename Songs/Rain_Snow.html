<p class="p1"><b>Rain and Snow - E</b></p>
<p class="p2">Well I married me a wife , gave me trouble all my life <br>
Ran me out in the cold rain and snow <br>
Now she's coming down the stairs , Combing back her yellow hair <br>
And her cheeks are as red as a rose <br>
As a rose, as a rose - And her cheeks are as red as a rose <br>
<br>
Well she went to her room, where she sang a baleful tune</p>
<p class="p2">Saying, “I cant, get a-long with you”</p>
<p class="p2">And I ain't got no use , For your red apple juice <br>
And I'm not gonna be treated this a way <br>
This a way, this a way - And I'm not gonna be treated this a way <br>
<br>
I see you sitting in the shed , Counting every dime I made <br>
Now I'm broke and I'm so hungry too <br>
….</p>
<p class="p2">….<br>
<br>
and I bade me a wife, gave me trouble all my life</p>
<p class="p2">Now I'm going where those chilly winds dont blow</p>
<p class="p2">Winds dont blow, Winds dont blow,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">Now I'm going where those chilly winds dont blow</p>
<p class="p2">repeat Rain &amp; Snow x 3<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
