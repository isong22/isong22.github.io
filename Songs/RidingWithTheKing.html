<h2>Riding With The King - C#</h2><div id="lyrics-body">
 <p class="verse">
  I dreamed I did a good job and I got well paid
  <br/>
  Blew it all at the penny arcade
  <br/>
  A hundred dollars on a kewpie doll
  <br/>
  I guess no white chick is gonna make me crawl
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  On a TWA, to the promised land
  <br/>
  Every woman, child and man
  <br/>
  Gets a Cadillac and a diamond ring
  <br/>
  Dont you know we're riding with the king?
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  He?s on a mission of mercy to the new frontier
  <br/>
  He?s gonna check us all on out of here
  <br/>
  Up to that mansion on a hill
  <br/>
  Where you can get your prescription filled
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  On a TWA to the promised land
  <br/>
  Everybody come on, clap your hands
  <br/>
  Dont you just love the way he sings
  <br/>
  Dont you know we're riding with the king?
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Bridge: (D - C# ... G - A )
  <br/>
  A red cape and shiny gold 45
  <br/>
  I never saw his face but I saw the light
  <br/>
  Tonight everybody's getting their angel wings
  <br/>
  Dont you know we're riding with the king?
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Well I stepped out of a mirror at ten years old
  <br/>
  With a suit cut sharp, as a razor and a heart of gold
  <br/>
  I had a guitar hanging just about waist high
  <br/>
  I'm gonna play that thing until the day I die
 </p>
