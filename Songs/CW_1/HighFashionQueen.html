<h2>High Fashion Queen - BBros</h2>b'<div id="lyrics-body">\n<p class="verse">\nThere\'s a place everyone of us can go to<br/>\nMaybe you have been there once or twice<br/>\nWhere all your friends just look at you and whisper<br/>\nThey want to give you nothing but advice<br/>\n<p class="verse">When you walk in they all know what you\'re after<br/>\nAnd the higher that you get the more they\'ll see<br/>\nIn a dark room filled with music, wine and laughter<br/>\nYour eyes keep searching for her constantly<br/>\n<p class="verse">Is it that one in the corner with her eyes filled with tears?<br/>\nOr is she the one who\'s having fun drinking too much beer?<br/>\n<p class="verse">Every night it\'s the same sad old procedure<br/>\nThe doorman winks at you on your way out<br/>\n\'Cause deep inside he knows you\'ll be returning<br/>\nAnd he\'s got something you can\'t live without<br/>\n<p class="verse">There\'s nothing new that can be said about dirt<br/>\nAnd there\'s nothing left inside your heart but the same old hurt<br/>\nOf an old love\'s fancy life that left you stranded in a dream<br/>\nAin\'t you glad you\'re a high fashion queen?<br/>\nAin\'t you glad you\'re a high fashion queen?<br/>\n</p></p></p></p></p></div>'
