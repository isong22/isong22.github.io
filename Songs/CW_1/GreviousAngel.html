<h2> Return of the Grievous Angel </h2>b'<div id="lyrics-body">\n<p class="verse">\nWon\'t you scratch my itch, sweet Annie Rich , And welcome me back to town <br/>\nCome out on your porch or I\'ll step into your parlor <br/>\nAnd I\'ll tell you how it all went down <br/>\n<br/>\nOut with the truckers and the kickers And the cowboy angels <br/>\nAnd a good saloon in every single town <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and I remember something you once told me And I\'ll be damned if it did not come true <br/>\nTwenty thousand roads I went down, down, down <br/>\nAnd they all lead me Straight back home to you <br/>\n<p class="verse">\nWe flew straight across that river bridge, Last night half past two <br/>\nThe switchman waved his lantern goodbye And good day as we went rolling through <br/>\nBillboards and truck stops Pass by the grievous angel <br/>\nAnd now I know just what I have to do <br/>\n<p class="verse">\n\'Cause I headed west to grow up with the country <br/>\nAcross those valleys with those waves of grain <br/>\nAnd I saw my devil and I saw my deep blue sea <br/>\nAnd I thought about a calico bonnet From Cheyenne to Tennessee <br/>\n<br/>\n<p class="verse">\nThe news I could bring I met up with the king On his head an amphetamine crown <br/>\nHe talked about unbuckling that old bible belt And headed out for some desert town. <br/>\n<br/>\nOut with the truckers and the kickers And the cowboy angels <br/>\nAnd a good saloon in every single town <br/>\nOh, and I remember something you once told me And I\'ll be damned if it did not come true <br/>\nTwenty thousand roads I went down, down, down And they all lead me Straight back home to you <br/>\nTwenty thousand roads I went down, down, down <br/>\nAnd they all lead me Straight back home to you <br/>\n<br/>\nSongwriters: GRAM PARSONS, BEAU BROWN<br/>\n</p></p></p></p></div>'
