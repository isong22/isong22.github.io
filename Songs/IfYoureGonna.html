<verse>
Theres a closet full of dresses that I bought you <br>
And here's the keys to the new car in the drive. <br>
And before you leave our room, Put on your best perfume. <br>
If you're gonna do me wrong, do it right.
</verse>
<p> 
<verse>
Oh, the next time the phone rings, I won't answer <br>
I don't want to be the fool I was tonight <br>
I don't want to know the truth, I don't want to see the proof.<br>
If you're gonna do me wrong, honey do it right 
</verse>
<p>
<chorus>
If you're gonna break my heart , all to pieces <br>
Just walk right out, and leave me , any day or tonight
</chorus>

<verse>
Take off your wedding band, When he takes you by the hand. <br>
If you're gonna do me wrong, do it right <br>
<br>
Take off your wedding band ,When he takes you by the hand <br>
If you're gonna do me wrong, do it right.
