<h2>Deep River Blues</h2>
E
<verse><br>
Let it rain, let it pour<br>
Let it rain, a whole lot more, cause<br>
I got them deep river blues,<br>
Let the rain, drive right on<br>
Let the waves, sweep along, cause<br>
I got them deep river blues.<br>

<verse><br>
My old gal's, a good old pal,<br>
And she looks, like a water fowl, when<br>
I get them deep river blues,<br>
Ain't no one, to cry for me,<br>
(And the) fish all go out, on a spree when<br>
I get them deep river blues.<br>

<verse><br>
Give me back, my old boat<br>
I'm gonna sail, if she'll float, cause<br>
I got them deep river blues,<br>
I'm goin' back, to Mussel Shoals,<br>
Times are better, there I'm told, cause<br>
I got them deep river blues.<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>

<verse><br>
If my boat, sinks with me<br>
I'll go down, don't you see, cause<br>
I got them deep river blues,<br>
Now I'm gonna, say good-bye<br>
'N if I sink, just let me die, cause<br>
I got them deep river blues.<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
