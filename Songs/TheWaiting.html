<p class='verse'>
Oh, baby, don't it feel like heaven right now<br >
Don't it feel like something from a dream<br >
Yeah, I've never known nothing quite like this<br >
Don't it feel like tonight might never be again<br >
Baby, we know better than to try and pretend<br >
Honey, no one could've ever told me 'bout this<br >
I said yeah yeah (yeah yeah)<br >
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br >

<p class='verse'><b>Chorus</b><br />
The waiting is the hardest part<br >
Every day you see one more card<br >
You take it on faith, you take it to the heart<br >
The waiting is the hardest part<br >

<p class='verse'>
Well, yeah, I might have chased a couple women around<br >
All it ever got me was down<br >
Yeah, then there were those that made me feel good<br >
But never as good as I feel right now<br >
Baby, you're the only one that's ever known how<br >
To make me wanna live like I wanna live now<br >
I said yeah yeah (yeah yeah)<br >
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br >

<p class='verse'><b>Chorus</b><br />
<p class='verse'><b>Bridge</b><br />
Oh, don't let it kill you, baby, don't let it get to you<br >
Don't let it kill you, baby, don't let it get to you<br >
I'll be your bleedin' heart, I'll be your cryin' fool<br >
Don't let this go too far, don't let it get to you<br >
<p class='verse'><b>Instr Verse</b><br />
<br >
Yeah yeah (yeah yeah)<br >
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br >
<p class='verse'><b>Chorus</b><br />
Yeah, the waiting is the hardest part<br >
Whoa, it's the hardest part<br >
Whoa, it's the hardest part<br >
