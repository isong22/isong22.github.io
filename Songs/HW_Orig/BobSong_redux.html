<br>Intro: 8m on verse

<p class=sg_lyric>
Well I once knew a Pilot named Bob<br>
B-O-B Bob was nobody's slob<br>
B-O-B Bob, was smarter than us<br>
Coz Bob, he took his honey out to Oz<br>

<div class=sg_chorus_all>
<p class=sg_lyric>
<b>Chorus</b><br>
He said You swing from your tree, And I'll swing from mine<br>
You have your lemons and I'll have my lime<br>
Funny, we all act like monkeys sometimes<br>
So you swing from your tree - And I'll swing from mine.<br>
</div>

<p class=sg_lyric>
He said &quot;I'd rather make love, Than war<br>
I'd rather be Lucky,  Than to ever be poor<br>
I'd rather be Flying, Than to work anymore<br>
_____ I Guess I'm, tangled in a vine &quot;<br>
<p class=sg_lyric>
<b>Chorus</b> <br>
You save your dollar and I'll save my dime<br>
<p class=sg_lyric>
Vamp on verslet<br>
You swing from your tree<br>
we'll all be happy sometime<br>
<p class=sg_lyric>
Chorus<br>
<p class=sg_lyric>
we'll all be happy sometime<br>
