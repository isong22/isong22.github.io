Verse:
E           A                 E           A
I like the way your sparkling earrings
    E            A         B7      B7add4
lay against your skin so brown
E             A                     E      A
And I want to sleep with you in the desert tonight
E                          A        B7sus4     B7
with a billion stars all around


Chorus:
'Cause I got a peaceful easy feeling
And I know you won't let me down
           E  F#m? A      B7       E          Esus4  E  Esus4  E
'cause I'm already standin' on the ground


Verse:
And I found out a long time ago
what a woman can do to your soul
All that she can take you anyway
You don't already know how to go


Chorus:
And I got a peaceful easy feeling
And I know you won't let me down
'cause I'm already standin' on the ground

Esus4 - E - A - E - A - E - A - B7
E - A - E - A - E - A - B7 - A
E - A - B7 - E - F#m? - A - B7


Verse:
I get this feeling I may know you
as a lover and a friend
This voice keeps whispering in my other ear
it tells me I may never see you again


Chorus:
'Cause I got a peaceful easy feeling
And I know you won't let me down
'cause I'm already standin'
I'm already standin'
Yes I'm already standin' on the ground

(some melodic woo wooing)
