   I have seen the morning
burning golden on the mountains, in the skies.
   <br/>
   Achin' with the
feelin' of the freedom of an eagle, when she flies.
   <br/>
   Turnin' on the
world, the way she smiled upon my soul, as I lay dying.
   <br/>
   Healin' as
the colors in the sunshine, and the shadows of her eyes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wakin'
in the mornin', to the feelin' of her fingers on my skin.
   <br/>
   Wipin'
out the traces of the people, and the places that I've been.
   <br/>
   Teachin'
me that yesterday, was something that I never thought of,
trying.
   <br/>
   Talkin' of tomorrow, and the money, love and time we had
to spend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lovin' her was easier than anything I'll ever do
again.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Comin' close together with a feelin' that I've never
known before, in my time.
   <br/>
   She ain't ashamed to be a woman, or
afraid to be a friend.
   <br/>
   I don't know the answer, to the easy way
she opened every door, in my mind.
   <br/>
   But dreamin' was as easy as
believin' it was never gonna end.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And lovin' her was easier
than anything I'll ever do again.
