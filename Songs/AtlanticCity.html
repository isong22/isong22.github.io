<h2> Atlantic City </h2><div id="lyrics-body">
 <p class="verse">
  Well they blew up the chicken man in Philly last night  - now they blew up his house too
  <br/>
  Down on the boardwalk they're gettin' ready for a fight  - gonna see what them racket boys can do
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now there's trouble bustin' in from outta state  - and the D.A. can't get no relief
  <br/>
  Gonna be a rumble out on the promenade  - and the gamblin' commissions hangin' on by the skin of its teeth
  <br/>
  <br/>

   CHORUS
  </b>
  <br/>
  Everything dies baby that's a fact
  <br/>
  But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
  <br/>
  Put your makeup on,  fix your hair up pretty,  and meet me tonight in Atlantic City
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Well I got a job and tried to put my money away
  <br/>
  But I got debts that no honest man can pay
  <br/>
  So I drew what I had from the Central Trust
  <br/>
  And I bought us two tickets on that Coast City bus
  <br/>
  <br/>

   CHORUS

   Bridge
  </b>
  <br/>
  Now our luck may have died and our love may be cold
  <br>
   but with you  - forever I'll stay
   <br/>
   We're goin' out tonight, where the sand's turn to gold
   <br>
    so put on your stockin's on, cause the night's getting cold
    <br/>
    <b>
     CHORUS
    </b>
    <br/>
    Now I been lookin' for a job but it's hard to find
    <br/>
    Down here it's just winners and losers and don't get caught on the wrong side of that line
    <br/>
    Well I'm tired of comin' out on the losin' end
    <br/>
    So honey last night I met this guy and I'm gonna do a little favor for him
    <p>
     <b>
      CHORUS

     Meet me tonight in Atlantic City
     <br/>
     Meet me tonight in Atlantic City
     <br/>
     Meet me tonight in Atlantic City
     <br/>
     Meet me tonight in Atlantic City...
