<p class="p3"><h2>Generatons of Change â€“ Noel McLoughlin (as we learned from Susan Allen)</h2>
<p class="p3">My father was a baillie from a wee farm at Caiplie</p>
<p class="p3">He worked on the land all the days of his life</p>
<p class="p3">By the !me he made second, he aye said he reckoned</p>
<p class="p3">he'd ploughed near on half of the east nuke of Fife.</p>
<p class="p3">He worked on at Randerston, Crawhill and Clephinton</p>
<p class="p3">Cambo and Carnbee and Big Rennyhill</p>
<p class="p3">At Kingsbarns he married, at Boarhills he's buried</p>
<p class="p3">But man, had he lived, he'd be ploughing on still</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="p3">For those days were his days, those ways were his ways</p>
<p class="p3">To follow the plough while his back was still strong</p>
<p class="p3">But those days are past and the !me came at last</p>
<p class="p3">For the weakness of age to make way for the young</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="p3">I was nae for ploughing, to the sea I was going</p>
<p class="p3">To follow the fish and the fisherman's ways</p>
<p class="p3">In rain, hail and sunshine I watched the long runline</p>
<p class="p3">No man mere contented his whale working day</p>
<p class="p3">I've lang lined the Fladden Ground, the Dutch and the Dogger Bank</p>
<p class="p3">Pulled the big fish from the deep Devil's Hole</p>
<p class="p3">I've side trawled off Shetland, the Faroes and Iceland</p>
<p class="p3">In weather much worse than a body could thole</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="p3">For that day was my day, that way was my way</p>
<p class="p3">To follow the fish while my back was still strong</p>
<p class="p3">But that day is past and the !me came at last</p>
<p class="p3">For the weakness of age to make way for the young</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="p3">My sons they have grown and away they have gone</p>
<p class="p3">To search for black oil in the far northern sea</p>
<p class="p3">Like oilmen they walk, and like yankees they talk</p>
<p class="p3">There's not much in common between my sons and me</p>
<p class="p3">They've rough-rigged on Josephine, Forties and Ninian</p>
<p class="p3">Claymore and Dunlin and Fisher and Awk</p>
<p class="p3">They've made fortunes for sure, for in one trip ashore</p>
<p class="p3">They spend more than I earned in a whole season's work</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="p3">For this day is their day, this way is their way</p>
<p class="p3">To ride the rough rigs while their backs are still strong</p>
<p class="p3">But this day will pass and the !me come at last</p>
<p class="p3">For the weakness of age to make way for the young</p>
<p class="p3">My grandsons are growing, to the school they soon be goin'</p>
<p class="p3">But the lang weeks of summer they spend here with me</p>
<p class="p3">We walk through the warm days, we talk of the old ways</p>
<p class="p3">The cornfield, the codfish, the land and the sea</p>
<p class="p3">We walk through the fields that my father once !lled</p>
<p class="p3">Talk with the old men who once sailed with me</p>
<p class="p3">Man, it's been awfully good, I showed them all I could</p>
<p class="p3">Of the past and the present, what their future might be</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="p3">For the morn will be their day, what will be their way</p>
<p class="p3">What will they make of their land, sea and sky</p>
<p class="p3">Man, I've seen awfu' change, still it seems very strange</p>
<p class="p3">To look at my world through a young laddie's eyes</p>
