<h2>Cest La Vie (You Never Can Tell)</h2><div id="lyrics-body">
 <p class="verse">
  It was a teenage wedding, and the old folks wished
them well
  <br/>
  You could see that Pierre did truly love the
mademoiselle
  <br/>
  And now the young m'sieur and madame have rung the
chapel bell,
  <br/>
  C'est la vie, say the old folks, it goes
to show you never can tell
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  They furnished off an apartment with a two room Roebuck sale
  <br/>
  The coolerator was crammed with TV
dinners and ginger ale,
  <br/>
  But when Pierre found work, a little money
comin' worked out well
  <br/>
  C'est la vie, say the old
folks, it goes to show you never can tell
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  They had a hi-fi phono, boy, did they let it blast
  <br/>
  Seven hundred little records,
all rock, rhythm and jazz
  <br/>
  But when the sun went down, the rapid
tempo of the music fell
  <br/>
  C'est la vie, say the old
folks, it goes to show you never can tell
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  They bought a souped-up jitney, 'twas a cherry red '53,
  <br/>
  They drove it down New
Orleans , to celebrate their anniversary
  <br/>
  It was there that Pierre
was married to the lovely mademoiselle
  <br/>
  C'est la vie,
say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell
 </p>
