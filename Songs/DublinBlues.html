<h2>Dublin Blues - E</h2><div class="lyrics-body">
 <p class="verse">
  Well I wished I was in Austin, hmm,
  <br/>
  in the Chili Parlor Bar, Drinkin' Mad Dog Margaritas and not carin' where you are
  <br/>
  Here I sit in Dublin, hmm,
  <br/>
  just rollin' cigarettes, Holdin' back and chokin' back, the shakes with every breath
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Chorus:
  <br/>
  So forgive me all my anger, forgive me all my faults
  <br/>
  There's no need to forgive me, for thinkin' what I thought
  <br/>
  I loved you from the git go, and I'll love you till I die
  <br/>
  I loved you on the Spanish steps, the day you said goodbye
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  I am just a poor boy, hmm,
  <br/>
  work's my middle name,
If money was a reason, well I would not be the same
  <br/>
  I'll stand up and be counted, hmm,
  <br/>
  I'll face up to the truth, I'll walk away from trouble,
  <br/>
  but I can't walk away from you
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Chorus:
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  I have been to Fort Worth, hmm,
  <br/>
  (and) I have been to Spain, And I have been too proud to , come in out of the rain
  <br/>
  And I have seen the David, hmm,
  <br/>
  seen the Mona Lisa too, And I have heard Doc Watson play Those Lonesome Stockade Blues
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Chorus:
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Well I wished I was in Austin, hmm,
  <br/>
  in the Chili Parlor Bar,
Drinkin' Mad Dog Margaritas and not carin' where you are
