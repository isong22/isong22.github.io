<h2>Freight Train</h2>
C - finger
<verse><br>Chorus:<br>Freight train freight train goin' so fast<br>Freight train freight train goin' so fast<br>Please don't tell what train I'm on<br>So they won't know where I've gone.</verse>
<p>
<verse>Freight train, freight train, comin' round the bend<br>Freight train, freight train, gone again<br>One of these days turn that train around<br>Go back to my hometown.</verse><p>(Chorus)
<p><verse>One more place I'd like to be<br>One more place I'd love to see<br>To watch those old Blue Ridge Mountains climb<br>As I ride ol' Number Nine.</verse><p>(Chorus)
<p><verse>When I die please bury me deep<br>Down at the end of Bleecker Street<br>So I can hear ol' Number Nine<br>As she goes rollin' by.</verse><p>(Chorus)
