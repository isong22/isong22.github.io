 <p class="verse">
Marie Marie<br>
Playing guitar on the back porch, I sit in my car<br>
While she sings so sad, Marie Marie<br>
Marie Marie<br>
It's so lonely in these farmlands, Please come with me<br>
To the bright lights downtown, Marie Marie<br>
 <p class="verse">
<b>Bridge</b><br />
I said, "Hey, pretty girl Don't you understand<br>
I just,  want to,  be your loving man"<br>
 <p class="verse">
Marie Marie<br>
The sun is down in the corn fields, The evening is dark<br>
And you sing so sad, Marie Marie<br>
 <p class="verse">
Marie Marie<br>
I got two weeks in back pay, There's gas in my car<br>
And your folks say I must go, Marie, Marie<br>

Marie Marie<br>
Playing guitar on the back porch, I leave in my car<br>
While you sing so sad, Marie Marie<br>
And your folks say I must go, Marie, Marie<br>
