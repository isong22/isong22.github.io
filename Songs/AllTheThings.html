                The Byrds     All The Things written by  Roger McGuinn/Jacques Levy

D                  C            G           D 
See the sun how bright it is it never was before
D                 C                    G                
See the sun it shines right through my door but no-ones's there
      D             D7         G                 Gm
I see warm smiles I never gave reflecting in the air
D                  G        D                 G            D
All the things I want today All the things I wasted on the way
D                 C                  G                 D
See the earth how sweet it smells I don't know how it feels
                 C                G
See the earth it slips beneath my heels as I pass thru
      D            D7            G             Gm  
I see tears that I never shed in every drop of dew
D                G          D                G             D
All the things I want today All the things I wasted on the way
Em                     D 
Hear the skies singing songs I could have played
Am                  C            G
Too busy talking to prove that I was not afraid
D                 C                 G          D
See this dried up broken straw it's turning to rot
                  C                G
See this dried up broken straw forgotten left behind
      D             D7            G             Gm
I see things that I never done a blowing in the wind
D                G          D                G             D
All the things I want today All the things I wasted on the way
