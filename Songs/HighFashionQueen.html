<h2>High Fashion Queen - BBros</h2>
<div id="lyrics-body">
<p class="verse">There's a place everyone of us can go to<br/>
Maybe you have been there once or twice<br/>Where all your friends just look at you and whisper<br/>
They want to give you nothing but advice<br/><p class="verse">When you walk in they all know what you're after<br/>
And the higher that you get the more they'll see<br/>In a dark room filled with music, wine and laughter<br/>
Your eyes keep searching for her constantly<br/>
</p> 

<p class="verse">Is it that one in the corner with her eyes filled with tears?<br/>
Or is she the one who's having fun drinking too much beer?<br/>
</p> 

<p class="verse">Every night it's the same sad old procedure<br/>
The doorman winks at you on your way out<br/>
Cause deep inside he knows you'll be returning<br/>
And he's got something you can't live without<br/>
</p> 

<p class="verse">There's nothing new that can be said about dirt<br/>
And there's nothing left inside your heart but the same old hurt<br/>
Of an old love's fancy life that left you stranded in a dream<br/>
Ain't you glad you're a high fashion queen?<br/>
Ain't you glad you're a high fashion queen?<br/>
</p>
