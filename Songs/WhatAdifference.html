<h2>What A Difference A Day Makes</h2>
G
<p>
<verse>
What a difference a day makes<br>
Twenty-four little hours<br>
Brought the sun and the flowers<br>
Where there used to be rain<br>
My yesterday was blue, dear<br>
Today I'm a part of you, dear<br>
My lonely nights are through, dear<br>
Since you said you were mine
</verse>
<p> 
<verse>
What a difference a day makes<br>
There's a rainbow before me<br>
Skies above can't be stormy<br>
Since that moment of bliss, that thrilling kiss<br>
It's heaven when you find romance on your menu<br>
What a difference a day made<br>
And the difference is you
</verse>
