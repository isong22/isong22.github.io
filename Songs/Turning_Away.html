<br>
In darkness we do what we can, In daylight we're oblivion<br>
Our hearts so raw and clear<br>
Are turning away, turning away from here<br>
<br>
</span>On water we have walked, like the fearless child<br>
What was fastened we've unlocked revealing wondrous wild<br>
And in search for confirmation<br>
We have jumped into the fire<br>
And scrambled with our burning feet through uncontrolled desire<span class="s1"><br>
<br>
<i>Chorus</i><br>
<br>
</span>There's a well upon the hill from our ancient past<br>
Where an age is standing still holding strong and fast<br>
And there's those that try to tame it, And the carve it into stone<br>
Ah but words cannot extinguish it, However hard they're thrown<span class="s1"><br>
<br>
<i>Chorus</i><br>
<br>
</span>On Lock Etive, they have worked with their highland dreams<br>
By Kilchrenan, they have nourished in the mountain streams<br>
And in searching for acceptance, They have given it away<br>
Only the children of our children, Know the price they had to pay</p>
