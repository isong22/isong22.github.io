<h2>Ashes by Now</h2><div id="lyrics-body">
 <p class="verse">
  This morning is Monday Where are you now?
  <br>
   Teasin' my memory Teaching me how to lay low
   <br>
    when I don't want to
    <br>
     <p class="verse">
      Your love is elusive this I know now
      <br>
       It's making me crazy Leaving me out ... In the open
       <br>
        When I don't want to
        <br>
        </br>
       </br>
      </br>
     </p>
     <p class="verse">
      Chorus:
      <font size="3">
       Em                                             G
      </font>
      <br>
       Baby, I can't go through this again
       <br>
        I don't need to go down, More than I've already been
        <br>
         Just like a wild fire, You're running all over town
         <br>
          As much as you burn me, baby - I should be ashes by now
          <br>
          </br>
         </br>
        </br>
       </br>
      </br>
     </p>
     <p class="verse">
      The moments of pleasures  Never do last
      <br>
       Are gone like a suitcase , full of your past
       <br>
        Long gone, and in a hurry
        <br>
         Chorus:
         <br>
          <p class="verse">
           The second street beggars  - alone in they life
           <br>
            Drunk on a sidewalk to hide - from the night
            <br>
             Like I am  They're just like I am
             <br>
              Chorus:
             </br>
            </br>
           </br>
          </p>
         </br>
        </br>
       </br>
      </br>
     </p>
