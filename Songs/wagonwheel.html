<h2>Wagon Wheel</h2><div id="lyrics-body">
 <p class="verse">
  Heading down south to the land of the pines
  <br/>
  I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
  <br/>
  Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
  <br/>
  Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
  <br/>
  And I'm a hopin' for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Chorus :
  <br/>
  So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
  <br/>
  Rock me mama any way you feel
  <br/>
  Hey mama rock me
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
  <br/>
  Rock me mama like a southbound train
  <br/>
  Hey mama rock me
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Running from the cold up in New England
  <br/>
  I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
  <br/>
  My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oh, north country winters keep a getting me now
  <br/>
  Lost my money playing poker so I had to up and leave
  <br/>
  But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chorus ..
  <br/>
  Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke
  <br/>
  I caught a trucker out of Philly, had a nice long toke
  <br/>
  But he's a heading west from the Cumberland Gap
  <br/>
  To Johnson City, Tennessee
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And I gotta get a move on before the sun
  <br/>
  I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
  <br/>
  And if I died in Raleigh, at least I will die free
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chorus .....

   Blue Christmas

   <p class="verse">
    I?ll have a blue Christmas without you
    <br/>
    I?ll be so blue just thinking about you
    <br/>
    Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
    <br/>
    Won?t be the same dear, if you?re not here with me
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And when the blue snowflakes start falling
    <br/>
    That?s when those blue memories start calling
    <br/>
    You?ll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
    <br/>
    But I?ll have a blue Christmas
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You?ll be doing alright with your Christmas of white

   <h3>
    In the Jailhouse Now
   </h3>
   I had a friend named Ramblin' Bob
   <br/>
   Who used to steal gamble and rob
   <br/>
   He thought he was he was the smartest guy around
   <br/>
   But I found out last Monday
   <br/>
   That Bob got locked up Sunday
   <br/>
   They've got him in the jailhouse way down town
   <br/>
   He's in the jailhouse now he's in the jailhouse now
   <br/>
   I told him once or twice stop playin' cards and shootin' dice
   <br/>
   He's in the jailhouse now
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yodel...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bob liked to play his Poker, Pinochle, Whist and Euchre But shooting dice
   <br/>
   But shootin' dice was his favorite game
   <br/>
   Well, he got throwed in jail, with nobody to go his bail
   <br/>
   The judge done said that he refused a fine
   <br/>
   He's in the jailhouse now he's in the jailhouse now
   <br/>
   I told him once or twice quit playin' cards and shootin' dice
   <br/>
   He's in the jailhouse now
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Well, I went out last Tuesday,
   <br/>
   I met a girl named Suzie
   <br/>
   I said I was the swellest guy around"
   <br/>
   Well, we started to spendin' my money
   <br/>
   An' she started to callin' me honey
   <br/>
   We took in every cabaret in town
   <br/>
   We're in the jailhouse now
   <br/>
   We're in the jailhouse now
   <br/>
   I told that judge right to his face,
   <br/>
   I don't like to see this place
   <br/>
   We're in the jailhouse now
   <br/>
   Yodel...

   <h3>
    Halfway Down
   </h3>
   Raindrops on the treetops
   <br/>
   Waiting there to fall
   <br/>
   I know how they're feeling
   <br/>
   But I'm only, yes I'm only, halfway down
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fighting with the devil
   <br/>
   Harder all the time
   <br/>
   Sinkin' to his level
   <br/>
   But I'm only, yes I'm only, halfway down
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Halfway down, just a getting started
   <br/>
   Yes I'm beginning on my journey now
   <br/>
   But I've only gotten halfway down
   <br/>
   Halfway down, just a little bit farther
   <br/>
   Well I believe you better catch me now
   <br/>
   'Cause I'm only going halfway down
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sippin' shallow water
   <br/>
   Sharks out for the kill
   <br/>
   Almost hittin' bottom
   <br/>
   But I'm only, yes I'm only, halfway down
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Halfway down, just a getting started
   <br/>
   Yes I'm beginning on my journey now
   <br/>
   But I've only gotten halfway down
   <br/>
   Halfway down, just a little bit farther
   <br/>
   Well I believe you better catch me now
   <br/>
   'Cause I'm only going halfway down
   <br/>
   Yeah I hope you better catch me now
   <br/>
   'Cause I'm only going halfway down
   <br/>
   Yes I'm only going halfway down
   <br/>
   Yes I'm only going halfway down

   <h3>
    Walkin Talkin Beatin Heart
   </h3>
   If you see me in some corner looking like all hope is gone
   <br/>
   If you see me sit for hours and you wonder what is wrong
   <br/>
   Well, it hurts to talk about it but my world just fell apart
   <br/>
   I'm a walkin', talkin', cryin', barely beatin' broken heart
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Did you see the teardrops fallin' and the tremble in my hands
   <br/>
   Then you'll know that there's a story and nobody understands
   <br/>
   It's a sad and lonely story but I'll try to make it short
   <br/>
   I'm a walkin', talkin', cryin', barely beatin' broken heart
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Should you wonder how I got this way then listen, listen good
   <br/>
   He left me for another, thought he'd be the last who would
   <br/>
   So I'm tryin' to forget him, lookin' for a place to start
   <br/>
   I'm a walkin', talkin', cryin', barely beatin' broken heart
   <br/>
   <br/>
   You may wonder how I got this way then listen, listen good
   <br/>
   He left me for another, thought he'd be the last who would
   <br/>
   So I'm tryin' to forget him, lookin' for a place to start
I'm a walkin', talkin', cryin', barely beatin' broken heart

   <h3>
    There Is A Time
   </h3>
   <p>
    There is a time, for love and laughter
    <br/>
    The days will pass, like summer storms
    <br/>
    The winter wind, will follow after
    <br/>
    But there is love, and love is warm
    <br/>
    <p>
     Chorus:
     <br/>
     There is a time, for us to wander
     <br/>
     When time is young, and so are we
     <br/>
     The woods are greener, over yonder
     <br/>
     The path is new, the world is free
     <br/>
     <p>
      There is a time when, leaves are fallin'
      <br/>
      The woods are gray, the paths are old
      <br/>
      The snow will come, when geese are callin'
      <br/>
      You need a fi-re, against the cold
      <br/>
      <p>
       So do your roam - ing in the springtime
       <br/>
       And you'll find your love, in the summer sun
       <br/>
       The frost will come, and bring the harvest
       <br/>
       And you can sleep, when day is done
       <br/>
       <p>
        Life is like a rolling river
        <br/>
        With no regrets ,  a Deep Blue Song ?
        <br/>
        Around the bend, a shining morning
        <br/>
        To greet the friends, we thought were gone
       </p>
      </p>
