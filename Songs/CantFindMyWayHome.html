 <p class="verse">
  Come down off your throne and leave your body alone.
  <br/>
  Somebody must change.
  <br/>
  You are the reason I've been waiting so long.
  <br/>
  Somebody holds the key.
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  But I'm near the end and I just ain't got the time
  <br/>
  And I'm wasted and I can't find my way home.
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Come down on your own and leave your body alone.
  <br/>
  Somebody must change.
  <br/>
  You are the reason I've been waiting all these years.
  <br/>
  Somebody holds the key.
  <br/>

  Chorus
  <br/>
  But I can't find my way home.
  <br/>
  But I can't find my way home.
  <br/>
  But I can't find my way home.
  <br/>
  But I can't find my way home.
  <br/>
  Still I can't find my way home,
  <br/>
  And I ain't done nothing wrong,
  <br/>
  But I can't find my way home.
  <br/>
