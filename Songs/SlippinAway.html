<h2>Slipping Away  </h2><div id="lyrics-body">
 <p class="verse">
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh<br \>
I can feel you slipping away from me<br />
A little bit further now every day<br />
I'm holding on, but I can't believe<br />
This is how you want it to be<br />
 <p class="verse">
Oh, you're slipping away<br />
Oh, you're slipping away<br />
 <p class="verse">
It feels like walking down a long, dark road<br />
You never talk to me the way you did before<br />
You ride through the city with your head held high<br />
And all I can do is watch you go by<br />
 <p class="verse">
Oh, you're slipping away<br />
Oh, you're slipping away<br />
 <p class="verse">
  <b>Bridge</b>
you're slipping away<br />
you're slipping away<br />
you're slipping away<br />
you're slipping away<br />
<b>Key change at end of run up</b>
 <p class="verse">
I'm gonna give it all I've got to give<br />
I've got to hold on, see what tomorrow brings<br />
You're slipping away, but give me one more try<br />
One more chance to wipe these tears from my eyes<br />
You're slipping away<br />
Oh, you're slipping away<br />
  <b>Bridge 2 - walk up</b>
you're slipping away<br />
you're slipping away<br />
you're slipping away<br />
you're slipping away<br />
<b>repeat chorus and out</b>
