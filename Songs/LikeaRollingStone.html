<h2>Like A Rolling Stone</h2>
C
<verse><p>
Once upon a time you dressed so fine <br>
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?<br>
People'd call, say, "Beware doll, you're bound to fall" You thought they were all, kiddin' you<br>
You used to laugh about, everybody that was hangin' out<br>
Now you don't talk so loud, now you don't seem so proud<br>
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.<br>
</verse>
<p>Chorus:
How does it feel ? How does it feel ?<br>
To be without a home - <br>
Like a complete unknown - Like a rolling stone?<br>
</p>
<verse><p>
You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely But you know you only used to get juiced in it<br>
Nobody ever taught you how to live on the street<br>
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it<br>
You say you never compromised, With the mystery tramp, but now you realize<br>
He's not selling any alibis As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes<br>
And ask him do you want to make a deal?<br>
</verse></p>
<p>Chorus: </p>

<verse><p>
You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns<br>
When they all did - tricks for you<br>
You never understood that it ain't no good<br>
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you<br>
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your, diplomat<br>
Who carried on his shoulder a, Siamese cat<br>
Ain't it hard when you discover that, He really wasn't where it's at<br>
After he took from you everything he could steal. <br>
</verse></p>
<p>Chorus:</p>

<verse><p>
Princess of the steeple and all the pretty people<br>
They're drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made<br>
Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things<br>
you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babe<br>
You used to be so amused, At that Napoleon in rags and the language that he used<br>
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse<br>
When you aint got nothing, you got nothing to lose<br>
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.<br>
</verse></p>
<p>Chorus:
