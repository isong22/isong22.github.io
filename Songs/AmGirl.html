<h2>American Girl - D</h2> </a>
<div class="lyrics-body">
<p class='verse'>
Well, she was an American girl, raised on promises<br >
She couldn't help thinking that there,<br >
was a little more to life, somewhere else<br >
After all it was a great big world, with lots of places to run to, yeah, <br >
and if she had to die...  Tryin', she <br >
had one little promise she was gonna keep<br >
</p>
<p class='verse'>
Chorus:<br >
Oh yeah, alright, take it easy, baby, make it last all night<br >
She was an American girl<br >
</p>
<p class='verse'>
Well, it was kind of cold that night, she stood alone on the balcony<br >
Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by <br \>
out on 441, like waves crashing on the beach<br >
And for one desperate moment there, he crept back in her memory<br >
God, it's so painful , when something that's so close <br \>
 is still so far out of reach<br >
<br >
Chorus:<br >
<br >
Instr breakdown
<br >
Jangly outro with am gurl
