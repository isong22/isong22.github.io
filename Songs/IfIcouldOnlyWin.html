 <p class="verse">
  If I could only win your love
  <br/>
  I'd make the most of everything
  <br/>
  I'd proudly wear your wedding ring
  <br/>
  My heart would never stray one dream away
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If I could only win your love
  <br/>
  I'd give my all to make it live
  <br/>
  You'll never know how much I'd give
  <br/>
  If I could only win your love
  <br/>
  <br/>

  <br \=""/>
  Oh, how can I ever say
  <br/>
  How I crave your love, when you're gone away
  <br/>
  Oh, how can I ever show
  <br/>
  How I burn inside, when you hold me tight
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If I could only win your love
  <br/>
  I'd give my all to make it live
  <br/>
  You'll never know how much I'd give
  <br/>
  If I could only win your love.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oh, how can I ever say
  <br/>
  How I crave your love, when you're gone away
  <br/>
  Oh, how can I ever show
  <br/>
  How I burn inside, when you hold me tight
  <br/>
  <br/>
