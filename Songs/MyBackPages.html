<h2>My Back Pages - D</h2><div id="lyrics-body">
 <p class="verse">
  Crimson flames tied through my ears -  Rollin' high and mighty traps
  <br/>
  Pounced with fire on flaming roads - Using ideas as my maps
  <br/>
  'We'll meet on edges, soon,' said I -  Proud ?neath heated brow
  <br/>
  Ah, but I was so much older then
  <br/>
  I'm younger than that now
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth  - 'Rip down all hate,' I screamed
  <br/>
  Lies that life is black and white -  Spoke from my skull. I dreamed
  <br/>
  Romantic flanks of musketeers -  Foundation deep, somehow
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand At the mongrel dogs who teach
  <br/>
  Fearing not that I'd become my enemy In the instant that I preach
  <br/>
  My pathway led by confusion boats Mutiny from stern to bow
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats Too noble to neglect
  <br/>
  Deceived me into thinking I had something to protect
  <br/>
  Good and bad, I define these terms Quite clear, no doubt, somehow
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Girls' faces formed the forward path From phony jealousy
  <br/>
  To memorizing politics Of ancient history
  <br/>
  Flung down by corpse evangelists Unthought of, though, somehow
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  A self-ordained professor?s tongue Too serious to fool
  <br/>
  Spouted out that liberty Is just equality in school
  <br/>
  'Equality,' I spoke the word As if a wedding vow
 </p>
