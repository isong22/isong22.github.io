<h2> Born on the Bayou </h2><div id="lyrics-body">
 <p class="verse">
  when i was just a little boy, standin' to my daddy's knee
  <br/>
  poppa said son don't let the man gitcha, do what he done to me
  <br/>
  ..
  <br/>
  i can remember the fourth of July, runnin thru the backwood bayin'
  <br/>
  i can still hear my ole hounddog barkin',
  <br/>
  chasin' down a hoo-doo there, chasin' down a hoo-doo there
  <br/>
  <br/>
  born on the bayou, born on the bayou, born on the bayou
  <br/>
  <br/>
  (long as hell break)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  wish i was back on the bayou, rollin with some cajun queen
  <br/>
  wish i was a fast freight train, just a'chooglin' on down to new orleans,
  <br/>
  chooglin' on down to neworleans
  <br/>
  <br/>
  born on the bayou, born on the bayou, born on the bayou
  <br/>
