  Thinkin' 'bout the times you drove in my car.
  <br/>
  Thinkin' that I might have drove you too far.
  <br/>
  And I'm thinkin' 'bout the love that you laid on my table.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I told you not to wander 'round in the dark.
  <br/>
  I told you 'bout the swans, that they live in the park.
  <br/>
  Then I told you 'bout our kid, now he's married to Mabel.
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Jangle change ...
  <br/>
  Yes, I told you that the light goes up and down.
  <br/>
  Don't you notice how the wheel goes 'round?
  <br/>
  And you better pick yourself up from the ground
  <br/>
  Before they bring the curtain down,
  <br/>
  Yes, before they bring the curtain down.
  <br/>

 <p class="verse">
  Talkin' 'bout a girl that looks quite like you.
  <br/>
  She didn't have the time to wait in the queue.
  <br/>
  She cried away her life since she fell off the cradle.
