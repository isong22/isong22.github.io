Satisfied Mind


How many times have, you heard someone say
If I had his money, I could do things my way
But little they know, that it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten, with a satisfied mind

Money can't buy back, your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonesome, or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person, is a pauper at times
Compared to the man, with a satisfied mind

When my life has ended, and my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones, I'll leave there's no doubt
But one thing's for certain, when it comes my time
I'll leave this old world, with a satisfied mind

How many times have, you heard someone say
If I had his money, I could do things my way
But little they know, that it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten, with a satisfied mind
One rich man in ten, with a satisfied mind
