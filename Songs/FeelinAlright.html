<h2>Feelin Alright</h2><div id="lyrics-body">
 <p class="verse">
  Seems I've got to have a change of scene
  <br>
   'Cause every night I have the strangest dream
   <br>
    Imprisoned by the way it could have been
    <br>
     Left here on my own or so it seems
     <br>
      I've got to leave before I start to scream
      <br>
       But someone's locked the door and took the key
       <br>
       </br>
      </br>
     </br>
    </br>
   </br>

  Chorus:
  <br/>
  You feelin' alright?
  <br>
   I'm not feelin' too good myself
   <br>
    Well, you feelin' alright?
    <br>
     I'm not feelin' too good myself, oh yeah
     <br>
     </br>
    </br>
   </br>
  </br>
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Well, boy you sure took me for one big ride
  <br>
   And even now I sit and wonder why
   <br>
    That when I think of you I start to cry
    <br>
     I just can't waste my time, I must keep dry
     <br>
      Gotta stop believin' in all your lies
      <br>
       'Cause there's too much to do before I die
       <br>
       </br>
      </br>
     </br>
    </br>
   </br>
  </br>
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Don't get too lost in all I say
  <br>
   Though at the time I really felt that way
   <br>
    But that was then and now it's today
    <br>
     I can't get off yet and so I'm here to stay
     <br>
      'Til someone comes along and takes my place
      <br>
       With a different name, yes, a different face
       <br>
       </br>
      </br>
     </br>
