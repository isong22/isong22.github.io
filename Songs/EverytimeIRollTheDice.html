<h2>Everytime I Roll The Dice </h2><div id="lyrics-body">
 <p class="verse">
  She got a roof that don't leak, When the rain's coming down
  <br>
   She got a place I can sleep, Where I'll be safe and sound
   <br>
    She got a lock on her door, Oh but I got the key
    <br>
     And she don't walk the floor, But she worries about me
     <br>
      <p class="verse">
       Chorus:
       <br>
        Oh when her love has no strings, Shackles or chains
        <br>
         But I'm holdin on for dear life
         <br>
          She's like rollin a seven, every time I roll the dice
          <br>
           <p class="verse">
            She got a big Oldsmobile,  She got a dog that don't bite
            <br>
             She got a heart I can steal, Just like a thief in the night
             <br>
              She got a slow burning fire, She keeps the radio low
              <br>
               Oh when she gets all inspired, We let the good times roll
               <br>
                <p class="verse">
                 Chorus:
                 <br>
