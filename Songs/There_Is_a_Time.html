<h2>There Is A Time</h2>
<div class="lyrics-body">
<p>
There is a time, for love and laughter<br/>
The days will pass, like summer storms<br/>
The winter wind, will follow after<br/>
But there is love, and love is warm<br/>
<p>
Chorus:<br/>
There is a time, for us to wander<br/>
When time is young, and so are we<br/>
The woods are greener, over yonder<br/>
The path is new, the world is free<br/>
<p>

There is a time when, leaves are fallin\'<br/>
The woods are gray, the paths are old<br/>
The snow will come, when geese are callin\'<br/>
You need a fi-re, against the cold<br/>
<p>
So do your roam - ing in the springtime<br/>
And you\'ll find your love, in the summer sun<br/>
The frost will come, and bring the harvest<br/>
And you can sleep, when day is done<br/>
<p>
Life is like a rolling river<br/>
With no regrets ,  a Deep Blue Song ?
<br/>
Around the bend, a shining morning<br/>
To greet the friends, we thought were gone
</p></p></p>
