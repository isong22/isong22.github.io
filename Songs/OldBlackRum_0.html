<p class="p1">Old Black Rum <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Great Big Sea</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">I drank sixteen doubles for the price of one<br>
Trying to find the courage, to talk to one<br>
(I asked her) for a dance, Not a second glance<br>
My night had just begun<br>
<br>
Well I drink to the father and the holy ghost<br>
I'm kneeling at the altar of my nightly post<br>
(So I'll) raise a glass, not the first nor last<br>
Come join me in this toast<br>
<span class="s1"><br>
[Chorus:]<br>
('</span>cause the) Old Black Rum's, got a hold on me<br>
Like a dog wrapped round my leg<br>
And the old black rum's got a hold on me<br>
Will I live for another day? Hey, Will I live for another day?<br>
<br>
(Well the) Queen of George St just went, walking on by<br>
Walking on by with some guy who don't care<br>
That she stood in line, Since half past nine<br>
And spent three hours on her hair (On her hair!)<br>
<br>
(Well her) friend is looking at me with an, evil grin<br>
I think the bloody racket might, soon begin<br>
I must have said some thing, to the George street queen<br>
The boys are joining in!<br>
<span class="s2"><b><i><br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
</i></b></span>So I drank all of my money, And I slept out in the rain<br>
Everyday is different but the nights they're all the same<br>
You never see the sun, on the old black rum<br>
But I know I'm gonna do it again!<br>
<br>
[Chorus 2x]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
