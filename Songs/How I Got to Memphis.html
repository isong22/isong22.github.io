<H3>Thats How I Got To Memphis</H3>

<div>
<p class="verse">
If you love somebody enough<br>
You'll follow wherever they go<br>
That's how I got to Memphis, That's how I got to Memphis<br>
</p>
<p class="verse">
If you love somebody enough<br>
You'll go where your heart wants to go<br>
That's how I got to Memphis, That's how I got to Memphis<br>
<p class="bridge">
I know if you'd seen her you'd tell me 'cause you are my friend<br>
I've got to find her and find out the trouble she's in<br>
If you tell me that she's not here<br>
I'll follow the trail of her tears<br>
That's how I got to Memphis, That's how I got to Memphis<br>
</p>
<p class="verse">
She would get mad and she used to say<br>
That she'd come back to Memphis someday<br>
That's how I got to Memphis, That's how I got to Memphis<br>
</p>
<p class="verse">
I haven't eaten a bite<br>
Or slept for three days and nights<br>
That's how I got to Memphis, That's how I got to Memphis<br>
</p>
<p class="bridge">
I've got to find her and tell her that I love her so<br>
I'll never rest 'til I find out why she had to go<br>
Thank you for your precious time<br>
Forgive me if I start to cryin'<br>
That's how I got to Memphis <i>[x8]</i>
