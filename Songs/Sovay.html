<p class="h3">Sovay Sovay</p>
Sovay Sovay all on a day<br>
She dressed herself in man's array<br>
With a brace of pistols all at her side<br>
To meet her true love, to meet her true love, away she rides<br>
<br>
As she was galloping on the plain<br>
She met her true love and bid him stand<br>
"Stand and deliver, young man" she said<br>
"And if you do not, and if you do not, I'll shoot you dead"<br>
<br>
He delivered up his golden store<br>
And still she craved for one thing more<br>
"That diamond ring that I see you wear<br>
Oh hand it over, oh hand it over, and your life I'll spare"<br>
<br>
"From my diamond ring I would not part<br>
For it's a token from my sweetheart<br>
Shoot and be damned you rogue" said he<br>
"And you'll be hanged and you'll be hanged then for murdering me"<br>

<br>
Next morning in the garden green<br>
Young Sophie and her true love were seen<br>
He spied his watch hanging from her clothes<br>
Which made him blush lads, which made him blush lads like any rose<br>
<br>
Why do you blush you silly young thing?<br>
I thought to have that diamond ring<br>
'Twas I who robbed you all on that plain<br>
So here's your gold love, here's your gold and your watch and chain<br>
<br>
"I only did it for to know<br>
If you would be a man or no<br>
If you'd given me that ring" she said<br>
"I'd have pulled the trigger, pulled the trigger and shot you dead"<br>
