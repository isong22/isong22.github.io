Well, I've got to run to keep from hiding, <br>
And I'm bound to keep on riding. <br>
And I've got one more silver dollar, <br>
But I'm not gonna let them catch me, no, <br>
Not gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider. <br>
<br> 
And I don't own the clothes I'm wearing, <br>
And the road goes on forever, <br>
And I've got one more silver dollar, <br>
But I'm not gonna let them catch me, no <br>
Not gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider. <br>
<br> 
And I've gone by the point of caring, <br>
Some old bed I'll soon be sharing, <br>
And I've got one more silver dollar, <br>
<br> 
Repeat three times and Fade <br>
But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no <br>
Not gonna let them catch the Midnight Rider. <br>
