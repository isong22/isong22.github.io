<p class="verse">
I should'a quit you, long time ago<br/>I should'a quit
you, baby, long time ago<br/>I should'a quit you, and went on to
Mexico</p>
<p class="verse">
If I ha'da followed, my first mind<br/>If I ha'da
followed, my first mind<br/>I'd'a been gone, since my second time</p>
<p class="verse">
I should'a went on, when my friend come from Mexico
at me<br/>I should'a went on, when my friend come from Mexico at me<br/>I
was foolin' with ya baby, I let ya put me on the killin' floor</p>
<p class="verse">
Lord knows, I should'a been gone<br/>Lord knows, I
should'a been gone<br/>And I wouldn't've been here, down on the
killin' floor</p>
