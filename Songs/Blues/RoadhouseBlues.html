<h2>Roadhouse Blues </h2><div id="lyrics-body">
<p class="verse">
Yeah, keep your eyes on the road, Your hands upon the wheel<br/>Keep your
eyes on the road, Your hands upon the wheel<br/>We're goin' to the
Roadhouse, We're gonna have a real, Good time</p>
<p class="verse">
Back at the Roadhouse they got some bungalows<br/>Said At the Back of the
Roadhouse, They got some bungalows<br/>And that's for the people, Who
like to go down slow</p>
<p class="verse">
Chorus: <br>Let
it roll, baby, roll - Let it roll, baby, roll<br/>Let it roll, baby,
roll - Let it roll, all night long</br></p>
<p class="verse">
Back at the Roadhouse they got some bungalows<br/>Said At the Back of the
Roadhouse, They got some bungalows<br/>And that's for the people Who
like to go down slow<br/>They like to get it down slow - Like to get
it way down</p>
<p class="verse">
Ashen lady, Ashen lady<br/>Give up your vows, give up your vows<br/>Save our
city, save our city<br/>Right now</p>
<p class="verse">
Take it up, Take it up, Take it up, Way up!, Take it up</p>
<p class="verse">
Well, I woke up this morning, I got myself a beer<br/>Well, I woke up this
morning, and I got myself a beer<br/>The future's uncertain, and the
end is always near</p>
<p class="verse"> CHORUS ---
<br/> - Let it roll, all night long<br/><br/>by John Densmore /
Roby Krieger</p>
