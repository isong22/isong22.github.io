<h2>I'm Tore Down </h2><div id="lyrics-body">
<p class="verse">
I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the ground.<br/>I'm
tore down, I'm almost level with the ground.<br/>Well, I feel like
this when my , baby can't be found.</p>
<p class="verse">
I went to the river to jump in.<br/>My baby showed up
and said, I will tell you when.<br>
Well, I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the
ground.<br/>Well, I feel like this when my , baby can't be found.</br></p>
<p class="verse"> [Stops]<br>
I love you babe with all my - heart and soul;<br/>Love
like mine will never grow old.<br/>Love you in the morning and in the
evening too.<br/>Every time you leave me I get - mad with you.
Well, I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the
ground.<br/>Well, I feel like this when my , baby can't be found.</br></p>
<p class="verse"> [Stops]<br>
I love you baby - with all my might;<br/>Love like
mine is - out of sight.<br/>I'll lie for you if you - want me to.<br/>
I really don't believe that your love is true.<br>
But I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the
ground.<br/>Well, I feel like this when my baby can't be found.</br></br></p>
