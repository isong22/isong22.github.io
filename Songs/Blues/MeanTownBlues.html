  Yeah, I work for a dollar couldn not save a lousy
  <br/>
  Could not save a dime

  You know I worked for a dollar, couldn not save a lousy

    So I packed up my suitcase and I move on down
    <br/>
    Hit that lonesome road
    <br/>
    You know I packed up my suitcase
    <br/>
    And I hit that lonesome, move on down the road
    <br/>
    I'm still crying to make it when the day was done
