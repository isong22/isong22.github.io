<h2> Don't Keep Me Wonderin</h2>
<div id="lyrics-body">
<p class="verse">
Oh, tell me 'bout the car I saw, parked outside your door,  <br/>
tell me what you left me waiting, two or three hours for. <br/>
Tell me why when the phone rings baby,  <br/>
you're up and across the floor, <br/>
please don't keep me wonderin' no longer.
</p>
<p class="verse">
I think about the bad times, Lord I think about yours and mine, <br/>
you were lost in the silver spoon, thought I pulled you out in time. <br/>
And I hope that you got reasons, for the way that you've been lyin', <br/>
please don't keep me wonderin' no longer.
</p>
<p class="verse">
I think I'm gonna go now, but you know that I'll be back. <br/>
Now you can think it over Baby, tell me how you're gonna act. <br/>
I'm gonna keep on holding on, but I don't get no stronger, <br/>
please don't keep me wonderin' no longer.
