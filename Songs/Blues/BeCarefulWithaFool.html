  Man, be careful with a fool
  <br/>
  You know, someday he may get smart
  <br/>
  Be careful with a fool
  <br/>
  You know, someday he may get smart
  <br/>
  He will treat you so cool and chilly
  <br/>
  Till he will hurt you to your heart
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Yeah, you know, hate to remember
  <br/>
  Oh, what a fool I used to be, ha, ha
  <br/>
  Man, I hate to remember
  <br/>
  How foolish I used to be
  <br/>
  The way I used to love you, baby
  <br/>
  How bad it's gonna be
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  You know, I used to cry 'bout you, baby
  <br/>
  You know, I'd walk the streets late at night
  <br/>
  Used to cry about ya
  <br/>
  Walk the streets late at night
  <br/>
  If you love me just a little bit, baby
  <br/>
  Why in the world don't you treat me right?
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Ah, yeah ------ Oh, yeah  ------ Yeah, baby
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Uh, it's like finally over, baby, whoa
  <br/>
  I believe this is the end, ah, ah, yeah
  <br/>
  Finally over, baby, oh, I believe this is the end, ah
  <br/>
  I want to tell my baby, to forgive me for my sin
