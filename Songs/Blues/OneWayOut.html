<h2>One Way Out</h2>
<div id="lyrics-body">
<p class='verse'>
Ain't but one way out baby,  <br>
Lord I just can't go out the door. <br>
Ain't but one way out baby,  <br>
and Lord I just can't go out the door. <br>
Cause there's a man down there,  <br>
might be your man I don't know. <br>
<br> 
Lord you got me trapped woman,  <br>
up on the second floor; <br>
If I get by this time I won't be  <br>
trapped no more. <br>
So raise your window baby,  <br>
So I can ease out soft and slow. <br>
And your neighbors, no they won't be  <br>
Talking that stuff that they don't know. <br>
<br> 
I'm foolish Lord, to be here  <br>
in the first place, <br>
I know some man gonna walk in and  <br>
take my place. <br>
Ain't no way in the world,  <br>
I'm going out that front door <br>
Cause there's a man down there,  <br>
might be your man I don't know. <br>
Freely <br>
Lord, it just might happen to be your man... <br>
Lord, it just a might be your man, <br>
............Oh baby, I just don't know... <br>
