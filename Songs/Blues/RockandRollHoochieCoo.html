<h2>Rock and Roll - Hoochie Coo</h2><div id="lyrics-body">
 <p class="verse">
  I couldn't stop movin' when it first took hold
  <br/>
  It was a warm spring night at the old town hall
  <br/>
  There was a band called 'The Jokers', they were layin' it down
  <br/>
  Don't you know I'm never gonna lose that funky sound
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Hey, rock n' roll, hoochie koo
  <br/>
  Lawdy mama, light my fuse
  <br/>
  Rock n' roll, hoochie koo
  <br/>
  Truck on out and spread the news,
  <em>
   Lick --------
  </em>
  all right
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  I hope ya'll know what I'm talkin' about
  <br/>
  The way she wiggled that thing, it really knocks me out
  <br/>
  Gettin' high all the time, but if you're not there too
  <br/>
  Come on little closer, gonna do it to you
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Chorus:
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  'Squitas start buzzin' 'bout that time of year
  <br/>
  She's goin' 'round back, said she'd meet me there
  <br/>
  We was ballin' in the grass grown behind the barn
  <br/>
  Now my ears started ringin' like a fire alarm
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Chorus:
  <br/>
  Repeat Chorus:
  <br/>
  Truck on out and spread the news,
  <br/>
  Sure got tried of playing blues ... 3x
  <br/>
  STOPs - Lawdy mama, STOP -- light my fuse
  <br>
  </br>
