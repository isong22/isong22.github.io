<p class="verse">
Have you ever loved a woman<br/>So
much you tremble in pain?<br/>Have you ever loved a woman<br/>So much
you tremble in pain?<br/>And all the time you know<br/>She bears
another man's name.</p>
<p><font size="5" style="font-size: 20pt">But you just love that
woman<br/>so much it's a shame and a sin.<br/>You just love that
woman<br/>So much it's a shame and a sin.<br/>But all the time you
know<br/>She belongs to your very best friend.</font></p>
<p><font size="5" style="font-size: 20pt">Have you ever loved a
woman<br/>And you know you can't leave her alone?<br/>Have you ever
loved a woman<br/>And you know you can't leave her alone?<br/>Something
deep inside of you<br/>Won't let you wreck your best friend's home.</font></p>
