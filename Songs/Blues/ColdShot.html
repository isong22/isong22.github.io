<p class="verse">
Once was a sweet thang baby<br/>
Held out her lovin' in our hands <br/>Now I reach to
kiss your lips....The touch don't mean a thing <br/>And that's a cold
shot baby....Yeah that's a drag <br/>A cold shot baby....I let our
love go bad<br/><br/>Remember the way that you loved me....Do anything
I said <br/>Now I see you out somewhere....You won't give me the time
of day <br/>And that's a cold shot darlin'....Yeah that's a drag<br/>And
that's a cold shot baby....We let our love go bad<br/><br/>I really
meant I was sorry....For ever causin' you pain<br/>You showed your
appreciation....By walkin' out anyway<br/>And that's a cold shot
baby....Yeah that's a drag<br/>And that's a cold shot baby...We let
our love go bad<br/><br/>So sad....Too bad....So sad<br/>Don't let our
true love run cold baby
