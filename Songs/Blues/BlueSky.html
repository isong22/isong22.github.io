<p class='verse'>
Walk along the river, sweet lullaby,  <br>
it just keeps on flowing, It don't worry 'bout where it's going, no, no. <br>
<br> 
Don't fly, mister blue bird, I'm just walking down the road, <br>
Early morning sunshine tell me all I need to know <br>
<br> 
CHORUS <br>
You're my blue sky, you're my sunny day. <br>
Lord, you know it makes me high when you turn your love my way, <br>
Turn your love my way, yeah. <br>
<br> 
Good old Sunday morning, bells are ringing everywhere. <br>
Going to Carolina, it won't be long and I'll be there <br>
<br> 
Chorus: <br>
