<p class="verse">
Just one more mornin' <br/>
I had to wake up with the blues <br/>
Pulled myself outta bed, yeah <br/>
Put on my walkin' shoes, <br/>
Went up on the mountain, <br/>
To see what I could see, <br/>
The whole world was fallin', <br/>
right down in front of me. <br/>
<br/> 
[Chorus] <br/>
'Cause I'm hung up on dreams I'll never see, yeah Baby. <br/>
Ahh help me baby, or this will surely be the end of me, yeah. <br/>
<br/> 
Pull myself together, put on a new face, <br/>
Climb down off the hilltop, baby, <br/>
Get back in the race. <br/>
[Chorus] <br/>
