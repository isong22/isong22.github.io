The barrel-house told me, my baby caught that train 'n gone <br>
The barrel-house told me, my baby caught that train 'n gone <br>
It was all my fault, I musta' did somebody wrong. <br>
<br> 
Everything that happens, you know I am to blame. <br>
Everything that happens, you know I am to blame. <br>
I'm gonna find myself a doctor, perhaps my luck will change. <br>
<br> 
Ah, my mamma she told me, these days will surely come. <br>
I wouldn't listen to her, had to have my fun. <br>
The barrel-house told me, my baby caught that train 'n gone. <br>
But it's all my fault, I musta' done somebody wrong, oh yeah. <br>
<br> 
The barrel-house told me, my baby caught that train 'n gone <br>
The barrel-house told me, my baby caught that train 'n gone <br>
It was all my fault, I musta' did somebody wrong.  Oh play the blues... <br>
