You don't love me, pretty baby, <br>
you don't love me, yes I know. <br>
You don't love me, pretty baby <br>
you don't love me, yes I know. <br>
Well if you leave me, pretty baby <br>
don't you know you're gonna hurt me so. <br>
<br> 
Well I'm gonna tell my mother, <br>
I'm gonna talk to my father too. <br>
Well I'm gonna tell my sweet mother, <br>
I'll have a word with my father too. <br>
Well I'm gonna tell everybody, <br>
what those young girls will do to you. <br>
<br> 
Goodbye now, pretty baby, <br>
if I don't see you no more. <br>
Lord, goodbye now, pretty baby, <br>
if I never see you no more. <br>
Well if you think I'll be your fool, Lord, <br>
you better be on your merry way. <br>
