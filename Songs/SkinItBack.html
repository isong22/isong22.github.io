<h2>Skin It Back</h2><div id="lyrics-body">
 <p class="verse">
  Well I'm waitin' for something to take place
  <br/>
  Something to take me away from this race
  <br/>
  'Round city to city, town to town
  <br/>
  Runnin' around in the shoes of a clown
  <br/>
  And that desperate, no count, desperado
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A thief of love, my business is the street
  <br/>
  I been shakin' on down, In old Colorado
  <br/>
  Texas she's nice, but Georgia's oh so sweet
  <br/>
  Steal away with me darlin' your lovin' just can't be beat
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So it seems that the world keeps on turnin' but so what
  <br/>
  I don't doubt it, it just keeps on the move
  <br/>
  You're a dream, and that's all that I ask for
  <br/>
  So well now, I'm wonderin' just how I'm gonna tell it to you
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Skin it back (skin it back)
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Somethin' real, somethin' to feel
  <br/>
  I can't find a soul who'll take on this mess
  <br/>
  It's those rock and roll hours, early graves without flowers
  <br/>
  Please, please darlin' put my mind at rest
  <br/>
  (I'm beggin') please darlin' put my mind at rest
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So it seems that the world keeps on turnin' but so what
  <br/>
  I don't doubt it, it just keeps on the move
  <br/>
  You're a dream, and that's all that I ask for
  <br/>
  So well now, I'm wonderin' just how I'm gonna tell it to you
  <br/>
  Skin it back tell it to you                   x4
  <br/>
