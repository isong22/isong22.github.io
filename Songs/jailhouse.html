                <h3>In the Jailhouse Now Song Lyrics</h3>
                <hr>

I had a friend named Ramblin' Bob<br>
Who used to steal gamble and rob<br>
He thought he was he was the smartest guy around<br>
But I found out last Monday<br>
That Bob got locked up Sunday<br>
They've got him in the jailhouse way down town<br>
He's in the jailhouse now he's in the jailhouse now<br>
I told him once or twice stop playin' cards and shootin' dice<br>
He's in the jailhouse now<br>
<br>
Yodel...<br>
<br>
Bob liked to play his Poker, Pinochle, Whist and Euchre But shooting dice<br>
But shootin' dice was his favorite game<br>
Well, he got throwed in jail, with nobody to go his bail<br>
The judge done said that he refused a fine<br>
He's in the jailhouse now he's in the jailhouse now<br>
I told him once or twice quit playin' cards and shootin' dice<br>
He's in the jailhouse now<br>
<br>
Well, I went out last Tuesday, <br>
I met a girl named Suzie <br>
I said I was the swellest guy around"<br>
Well, we started to spendin' my money<br>
An' she started to callin' me honey<br>
We took in every cabaret in town<br>
We're in the jailhouse now<br>
We're in the jailhouse now<br>
I told that judge right to his face,<br>
I don't like to see this place<br>
We're in the jailhouse now<br>
Yodel...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
