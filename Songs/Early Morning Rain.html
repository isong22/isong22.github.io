<h2>Early Morning Rain</h2>

<p>
<verse><br>
In the early morning rain<br>
With a dollar in my hand<br>
With an achin' in my heart<br>
And my pockets full of sand<br>
I'm a long way from home<br>
And I miss my loved ones so<br>
In the early morning rain<br>
With no place to go<br>
<verse/>
<p>
<verse><br>
Out on runway number nine<br>
Big seven-o-seven set to go<br>
But I'm stuck here in the grass<br>
Where the cold wind blows<br>
Now the liquor tasted good<br>
And the women all were fast<br>
Well there she goes my friend<br>
She'll be rollin' down at last<br>
<verse/>

<p>
<verse><br>
Hear the mighty engines roar<br>
See the silver bird on high<br>
She's away and westward bound<br>
Far above the clouds she'll fly<br>
Where the mornin' rain don't fall<br>
And the sun always shines<br>
She'll be flyin' o'er my home<br>
In about three hours time<br>
<verse/>

<verse><br>
This old airport's got me down<br>
It's no earthly good to me<br>
Cause I'm stuck here on the ground<br>
Cold and drunk as I can be<br>
You can't jump a (big) jet plane<br>
Like you can a (old) freight train<br>
So I'd best be on my way<br>
In the early morning rain<br>
...<br>
You can't jump a jet plane<br>
Like you can a freight train<br>
So I'd best be on my way<br>
In the early morning rain<br>
