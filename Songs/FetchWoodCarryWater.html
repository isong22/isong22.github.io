<h2> Fetch Wood, Carry Water</h2><div id="lyrics-body">
 <p class="verse">
  Smell it in the desert when it starts to rain.
  <br/>
  Taste it in the snow falling up on the mountain.
  <br/>
  Feel it in the fire when it warms you with its glow.
  <br/>
  See it in the colors of the rainbow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trouble fly, let it go, bird on the wing.
  <br/>
  Fear not, when you breathe out you breathe in.
  <br/>
  In this very life you shall be free, yeah.
  <br/>
  You will find the time to rest your mind in luminosity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chorus --------------------
  <br/>
  You know the secret, but you never tell.
  <br/>
  You know the secret, but you keep it oh so well.
  <br/>
  Now baby don't go like a lamb to slaughter.
  <br/>
  I will fetch the wood.
  <br/>
  I will carry water.
  <br/>
  It's no chore, it's no bother.
  <br/>
  I will fetch the wood.
  <br/>
  I will carry water.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Evil times come with a bitter tribulation.
  <br/>
  All fall down without a strong foundation.
  <br/>
  Like a child on a battlefield, a candle in a hurricane.
  <br/>
  In this mad, mad world, only the mad are sane.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - Chorus
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Feather the paddle and the boat will row.
  <br/>
  Above the flood, beyond the flow.
  <br/>
  Feather the arrow of your mind and let it fly.
  <br/>
  Into the heart of the empty sky.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - Chorus
