<p class="h2">At the Sign of The Prancing Pony</p>

<p>
There is an inn, a merry old inn - Beneath the old grey hill<br>
And there they brew a beer so brown - That the man in the Moon himself came down<br>
One night to drink his fill<br>
<br>
The ostler has a tipsy cat - That plays a five-stringed fiddle <br>
And up and down he runs his bow -  Now squeaking high, now purring low<br>
Now sawing in the middle<br>
<br>
The landlord keeps a little dog - That is mighty fond of jokes<br>
When there’s good cheer among the guests - He cocks an ear at tall the jests<br>
And laughs until he chokes<br>
<br>
They also keep a horn’ed cow - As proud as any queen<br>
But music turns her head like ale - And makes her wave her tufted tail<br>
And dance upon the green<br>
<br>
And O! the rows of silver dishes - And the store of spoons!<br>
For Sunday there’s a special pair - And these they polish up with care<br>
On Saturday afternoons<br>
</p>
REEL !!!
<p>
The Man in the Moon was drinking deep - And the cat began to wail<br>
A dish and a spoon on the table danced - The cow in the garden madly pranced<br>
And the little dog chased his tail<br>
<br>
The man in the Moon took another mug - And then rolled beneath his chair<br>
And there he dozed and dreamed of ale - Till in the sky the starts were pale<br>
And dawn was in the air<br>
<br>
Then the ostler said to his tipsy cat - The white horses of the Moon<br>
They neigh and champ their silver bits - But their master’s been and drowned his wits<br>
And the Sun’ll be rising soon<br>
<br>
So the cat on his fiddle played hey-diddle-diddle - A jig that would wake the dead:<br>
He squeaked and sawed and quickened the tune - While the landlord shook the Man in the Moon<br>
“’Tis after three!” He said<br>
<br>
They rolled the Man slowly up the hill - And bundled him into the Moon<br>
While his horses galloped up the rear - And the cow came capering like a deer<br>
And a dish ran away with the spoon<br>
<br>
Now quicker the fiddle went deedle-dum-diddle - The dog began to roar<br>
The cow and the horses stood on their heads - The guests all bounded from their beds<br>
And danced upon the floor<br>
<br>
With a ping and a pang the fiddle strings broke! - The cow jumped over the Moon<br>
The little dog laughed to see such fun,   And the Saturday dish went off at run<br>
With the silver Sunday spoon<br>
<p>
The round Moon rolled behind the hill - As the Sun raised up her head<br>
She hardly believed her fiery eyes - For though it was day to her surprise<br>
They all went back to bed<br>
