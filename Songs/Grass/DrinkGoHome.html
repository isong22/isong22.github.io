<h2>Drink And Go Home</h2>
D - ?
<verse>
<br>You sit there crying, cry in your beer
<br>You think you got troubles, well, my friend listen here
<br>Don't tell me your troubles, I got enough of my own
<br>Be thankful you're living, drink up and go home
</verse>
<br>
<verse>
<br>I'm fresh out of prison, six years in the pen
<br>Lost my wife and family, no one to call friend
<br>Don't tell me your troubles, I got enough of my own
<br>Be thankful you're living, drink up and go home
</verse>
<br>
<verse>
<br>Now there stands a blind man, a man who can't see
<br>Yet he's not complaining, why should you or me?
<br>If you'd look around you, I'm sure you would find
<br>There's folks who got troubles, worse than yours and mine
</verse>
