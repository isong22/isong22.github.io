Freight Train

<p> 
Chorus:
<verse>
<br>Freight train freight train goin' so fast
<br>Freight train freight train goin' so fast
<br>Please don't tell what train I'm on
<br>So they won't know where I've gone.

</verse>
<p> 
<verse>
Freight train, freight train, comin' round the bend
<br>Freight train, freight train, gone again
<br>One of these days turn that train around
<br>Go back to my hometown.

<br>(Chorus)

</verse>
<p> 
<verse>
One more place I'd like to be
<br>One more place I'd love to see
<br>To watch those old Blue Ridge Mountains climb
<br>As I ride ol' Number Nine.

<br>(Chorus)

</verse>
<p> 
<verse>
When I die please bury me deep
<br>Down at the end of Bleecker Street
<br>So I can hear ol' Number Nine
<br>As she goes rollin' by.
<br>
<br>(Chorus) 
</verse>
