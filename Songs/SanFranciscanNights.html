<h3>SanFranciscan Nights</h3>
<div class="lyrics-body">
<b>Mando - clean2 </b>
<p class='verse'>Instr Lick Buzz Dragnet Theme ..../p>
<p class='verse'>This following program is dedicated to the city and people of San Francisco, Who may not know it but they are beautiful<br>
And so is their city - this is a very personal song<br>
So if the viewer cannot understand it, Particularly those of you who are European residents, 
Save up all your bread and fly TRANS-LOVE-Airways to San Francisco U.S.A.<br>
Then maybe you'll understand the song, it will be worth it, 
If not for the sake of this song but for the sake of your own peace of mind</p>
<p class='verse'>Instr Lick = harpsichord/mando</p>
<p class='verse'>Strobe lights beam, creates dreams<br>
Walls move minds do too, On a warm San Franciscan night<br>
Old child young child feel alright, On a warm San Franciscan night</p>
<p class='verse'>Angels sing, leather wings, Jeans of blue, Harley Davisons too<br>
On a warm San Franciscan night<br>
Old angels young angels, feel alright, On a warm San Franciscan night</p>
<p class='verse'>Bridge:<br>
I wasn't born there, perhaps I'll die there, There's no place left to go, .... San Francisco</p>
<p class='verse'>Instr Lick = harpsichord/mando - longer instr  12-string </p>
<p class='verse'>Cop's face, is filled with hate, Heavens above he's on a street called love, When will they ever learn ?<br>
Old cop, young cop, feel alright  ... On a warm San Franciscan night</p>
<p class='verse'>Bridge:<br>The children are cool, they don't raise fools, It's an American dream, includes Indians too</p>
<p class='verse'>STOP - Instr Lick = harpsichord/mando and out</p>
