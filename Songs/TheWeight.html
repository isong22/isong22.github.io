 <p class="verse">
  I pulled into Nazareth, was feelin' about half past dead;
  <br/>
  I just need some place where I can lay my head.
  <br/>
  "Hey, mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed?"
  <br/>
  He just grinned and shook my hand, and "No!", was all he said.
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  (Chorus:)
  <br/>
  Take a load off Fanny, take a load for free;
  <br/>
  Take a load off Fanny, And (and) (and) you can put the load right on me.
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  I picked up my bag, I went lookin' for a place to hide;
  <br/>
  When I saw Carmen and the Devil walkin' side by side.
  <br/>
  I said, "Hey, Carmen, come on, let's go downtown."
  <br/>
  She said, "I gotta go, but m'friend can stick around."
  <br/>
  (Chorus)
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothin' you can say
  <br/>
  It's just ol' Luke, and Luke's waitin' on the Judgement Day.
  <br/>
  "Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?"
  <br/>
  He said, "Do me a favor, son, woncha stay an' keep Anna Lee company?"
  <br/>
  (Chorus)
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Crazy Chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog.
  <br/>
  He said, "I will fix your rack, if you'll take Jack, my dog."
  <br/>
  I said, "Wait a minute, Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man."
  <br/>
  He said, "That's okay, boy, won't you feed him when you can."
  <br/>
  (Chorus)
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Catch a cannon ball now, and take me down the line
  <br/>
  My bag is sinkin' low and I do believe it's time.
  <br/>
  To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one.
  <br/>
  Who sent me here with her regards for everyone.
  <br/>
  (Chorus)
