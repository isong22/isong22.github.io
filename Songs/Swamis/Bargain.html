<h2>Bargain</h2><div id="lyrics-body">
 <p class="verse">
  I'd gladly lose me to find you
  <br/>
  I'd gladly give up all I had
  <br/>
  To find you I'd suffer anything and be glad
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I'd pay any price just to get you
  <br/>
  I'd work all my life and I will
  <br/>
  To win you I'd stand naked, stoned and stabbed
  <br/>
  I'd call that a bargain, The best I ever had, The best I ever had
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  I'd gladly lose me to find you
  <br/>
  I'd gladly give up all I got
  <br/>
  To catch you I'm gonna run and never stop
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  I'd pay any price just to win you
  <br/>
  Surrender my good life for bad
  <br/>
  To find you I'm gonna drown an unsung man
  <br/>
  I'd call that a bargain, ....

 <p class="verse">
  Bridge - D
  <br/>
  I sit looking 'round, I look at my face in the mirror
  <br/>
  I know I'm worth nothing without you
  <br/>
  And like one and one don't make two, One and one make one
  <br/>
  And I'm looking for that free ride to me, I'm looking for you
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  I'd gladly lose me to find you

  I'd gladly give up all I got
  <br/>
  To catch you I'm gonna run and never stop
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I'd pay any price just to win you
  <br/>
  Surrender my good life for bad
  <br/>
  To find you, I?m gonna drown an unsung man
  <br/>
  I'd call that a bargain, The best I ever had
