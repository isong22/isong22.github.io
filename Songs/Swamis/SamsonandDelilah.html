<h2>Samson and Delilah - G </h2><div id="lyrics-body">
 <p class="verse">
  Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair.
  <br/>
  Ooh, She had good looks and coal black hair
  <br/>
  Delilah she gained old Samsons mind
  <br/>
  When first he saw this woman, she looked so fine
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Delilah she climbed up on Samson's knee
  <br/>
  Said tell me where your strength lies if you please
  <br/>
  She spoke so kind and she talked so fair,
  <br/>
  Well Samson said, Delilah cut off my hair.
  <br/>
  You can shave my head, clena as my hand
  <br/>
  My Strength come as natural as any old Man
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Chorus:
  <br/>
  If I had my way, if I had my way, if I had my way
  <br/>
  I would tear this old building down.  | G C D#7 D |G / / /|

 <p class="verse">
  You read about Samson, all from his works,
  <br/>
  He was the strongest man that ever had lived on earth
  <br/>
  One day when Samson was walking along
  <br/>
  Looked down on the ground, he saw an old jawbone
  <br/>
  He stretched out his arm, chains broke like threads,
  <br/>
  When he got to moving, ten thousand was dead.
  <br/>
  Chorus:
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Now Samson and the lion, they got in attack .
  <br/>
  Samson he crawled up on the lion's back.
  <br/>
  You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paw
  <br/>
  Samson got his hands up around that lion's jaw.
  <br/>
  And he ripped that beast, lord he  Killed him Dead
  <br/>
  Now the bees make honey in the lions head.
  <br/>
  Chorus:
