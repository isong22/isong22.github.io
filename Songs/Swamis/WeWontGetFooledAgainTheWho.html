<h2>We Won't Get Fooled Again - The Who</h2><div id="lyrics-body">
 <p class="verse">
  We'll be fighting in the streets with our children at our feet
  <br>
   And the morals that they worship will be gone
   <br>
    And the men who spurred us on sit in judgment of all wrong
    <br>
     They decide and the shotgun sings the song
    </br>
   </br>
  </br>
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Chorus
  <br/>
  I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
  <br>
   Take a vow for the new revolution
   <br>
    Smile and grin at the change all around
    <br>
     Pick up my guitar and play, just like yesterday
     <br>
      Then I'll get on my knees and pray
      <br>
       We don't get fooled again
      </br>
     </br>
    </br>
   </br>
  </br>
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  The change, it had to come, we knew it all along
  <br>
   We were liberated from the fold, that's all
   <br>
    And the world looks just the same and history ain't changed
    <br>
     'Cause the banners, they are flown in the next war
     <br/>
     (Chorus)
    </br>
   </br>
  </br>
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Bridge :
  <br/>
  I'll move myself and my family aside
  <br>
   If we happen to be left half alive
   <br>
    I'll get all my papers and smile at the sky
    <br>
     Though I know that the hypnotized never lie
     <br>
      Do ya?
     </br>
    </br>
   </br>
  </br>
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  There's nothing in the streets, looks any different to me
  <br>
   And the slogans are replaced, by-the-bye
   <br>
    And the parting on the left is now parting on the right
    <br>
     And the beards have all grown longer overnight
     <br/>
     (Chorus)
    </br>
   </br>
  </br>
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Yeah
  <br>
   Meet the new boss - Same as the old boss
  </br>
