 <p class="verse">
  Out here in the fields i fight for my meals,
  <br/>
  I get my back into my livin'
  <br/>
  I don't need to fight to prove i'm right,
  <br/>
  I don't need to be forgiven
  <br/>
  No, no, no, no,   no-o
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Bridge ---
  <br/>
  Don't cry, don't brace your eyes,
  <br/>
  It's only teenage wasteland
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Sally take my hand, and move across south land,
  <br/>
  Put out the fire and don't look past my shoulder
  <br/>
  The exodus is here, but i'll be one more year,
  <br/>
  Let's get together before we get much older
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Teenage wasteland  - it's only teenage wasteland
  <br/>
  Teenage wasteland  - oh yeah it's only teenage wasteland
  <br/>
  they're all wasted !
