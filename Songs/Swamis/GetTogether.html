 <p class="verse">
  Love is but a song i sing, fear's the way we die
  <br/>
  You can make the mountians ring, or make the angels cry
  <br/>
  Thought the bird is on teh wing, and you may not know why
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chorus:
  <br/>
  Come on People now, smile on your brother
  <br/>
  Everybody Get Toghether, come and
  <br/>
  Love one-another right now
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some may come and some may go - this will surely pass
  <br/>
  When the one who left us here, returns for us at last
  <br/>
  We are but a moments sunlight,  fading in the grass
  <br/>

  Intro ------
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you hear the song I sing, you will understand ("listen")
  <br/>
  You hold the key to love and fear, all in your trembling hand
  <br/>
  Just one Key unlocks them both, Its there at your command
