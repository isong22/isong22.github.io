<h2>Rockin' In The Free World</h2><div id="lyrics-body">
 <p class="verse">
  There's colors on the street - Red, white and blue
  <br/>
  People shufflin' their feet
  <br/>
  People sleepin' in their shoes
  <br/>
  But there's a warnin' sign - on the road ahead
  <br/>
  There's a lot of people sayin' ,  we'd be better off dead
  <br/>
  Don't feel like Satan, but I am to them
  <br/>
  So I try to forget it, any way I can.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  (Chorus)
  <br/>
  Keep on rockin' in the free world,
  <br/>
  Keep on rockin' in the free world
  <br/>
  Keep on rockin' in the free world,
  <br/>
  Keep on rockin' in the free world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I see a woman in the night - With a baby in her hand
  <br/>
  Under an old street light , Near a garbage can
  <br/>
  Now she puts the kid away, and she's gone to get a hit
  <br/>
  She hates her life, and what she's done to it
  <br/>
  There's one more kid - that will never go to school
  <br/>
  Never get to fall in love, never get to be cool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  (Chorus)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We got a thousand points of light - For the homeless man
  <br/>
  We got a kinder, gentler, Machine gun hand
  <br/>
  We got department stores and toilet paper
  <br/>
  Got styrofoam boxes for the ozone layer
  <br/>
  Got a man of the people, says keep hope alive
  <br/>
  Got fuel to burn, got roads to drive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  (Chorus)
