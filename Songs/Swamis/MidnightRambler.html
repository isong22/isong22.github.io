<h2>Midnight Rambler - B </h2><div id="lyrics-body">
 <p class="verse">
  Did you hear about the midnight rambler
  <br/>
  Everybody got to go
  <br/>
  Did you hear about the midnight rambler
  <br/>
  The one that shut the kitchen door
  <br/>
  He don't give a hoot of warning
  <br/>
  Wrapped up in a black cat cloak
  <br/>
  He don't go in the light of the morning
  <br/>
  He split the time the cock'rel crows
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Talkin' about the midnight gambler
  <br/>
  The one you never seen before
  <br/>
  Talkin' about the midnight gambler
  <br/>
  Did you see him jump the garden wall
  <br/>
  Sighin' down the wind so sadly
  <br/>
  Listen and you'll hear him moan
  <br/>
  Talkin' about the midnight gambler
  <br/>
  Everybody got to go
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Did you hear about the midnight rambler
  <br/>
  Well, honey, it's no rock 'n' roll show
  <br/>
  Well, I'm talkin' about the midnight gambler
  <br/>
  Yeah, everybody got to go
  <br/>
  Well did ya hear about the midnight gambler?
  <br/>
  Well honey its no rock-in' roll show
  <br/>
  Well I'm talking about the midnight gambler
  <br/>
  The one you never seen before
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Oh don't do that, oh don't do that, oh don't do that
  <br/>
  Don't you do that, don't you do that (repeat)
  <br/>
  Oh don't do that, oh don't do that
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Slow down
  <br/>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Well you heard about the Boston...
  <br/>
  It's not one of those ......
  <br/>
  Well, talkin' 'bout the midnight...sh...
  <br/>
  The one that closed the bedroom door
  <br/>
  I'm called the hit-and-run raper in anger
  <br/>
  The knife-sharpened tippie-toe...
  <br/>
  Or just the shoot 'em dead, brainbell jangler
  <br/>
  You know, the one you never seen before
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  So if you ever meet the midnight rambler
  <br/>
  Coming down your marble hall
  <br/>
  Well he's pouncing like proud black panther
  <br/>
  Well, you can say I, I told you so
  <br/>
  Well, don't you listen for the midnight rambler
  <br/>
  Play it easy, as you go
  <br/>
  I'm gonna smash down all your plate glass windows
  <br/>
  Put a fist, put a fist through your steel-plated door
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Did you hear about the midnight rambler
  <br/>
  He'll leave his footprints up and down your hall
  <br/>
  And did you hear about the midnight gambler
  <br/>
  And did you see me make my midnight call
  <br/>
  And if you ever catch the midnight rambler
  <br/>
  I'll steal your mistress right from under your nose
  <br/>
  I'll go easy with your cold fanged anger
  <br/>
  I'll stick my knife right down your throat, baby .........  And it hurts!
  <br/>
