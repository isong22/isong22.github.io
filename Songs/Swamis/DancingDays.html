<h2>Dancing Days </h2><div id="lyrics-body">
 <p class="verse">
  Dancin' days are here again, the summer evenings grow
  <br/>
  I got my flower, I got my power, I got a woman who knows
  <br/>
  I said, it's alright, y'know it's alright,
  <br/>
  I guess it's all in my heart
  <br/>
  You'll be my only, my one and only,
  <br/>
  Is that the way it should start
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Crazy ways are evident in the way you're wearin' your clothes
  <br/>
  Sippin' booze is precedent as the evening starts to glow
  <br/>
  Y'know it's alright, I said, it's alright,
  <br/>
  Y'know it's all in my heart
  <br/>
  You'll be my only, my one and only,
  <br/>
  Is that the way it should start, dig, now
 </p>

 <p class="verse">
  You told your mama I'd get you home, but you didn't say that I had no car
  <br/>
  I saw a lion, he was standin' alone with a tadpole in a jar
  <br/>
  You know it's alright, I said, it's alright,
  <br/>
  I guess it's all in my heart, heart, heart
  <br/>
  You'll be my only, my one and only,
  <br/>
  Is that the way it should start
 </p>

  <br/>
  I said, it's alright, y'know it's alright
  <br/>
  You know it's all in my heart
  <br/>
  You'll be my only, yes, my one and only, yes
  <br/>
  Is that the way it should start
  <br/>
  I know that it's right
