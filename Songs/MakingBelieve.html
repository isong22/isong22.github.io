<h2>Making Believe</h2>
D - ?
<verse>
<br>Making believe that you still love me
<br>It's leaving me alone and so blue
<br>Still I'll always dream, but I'll never own you
<br>Making believe, it's all I can do
</verse>
<p> 
<verse>
Can't hold you close when you're not with me
<br>You're somebody's love, you'll never be mine
<br>Making believe I'll spend my lifetime
<br>Loving you and making believe
</verse>
<p> 
<verse>
Making believe I never lost you
<br>But my happy hours I find are so few
<br>My plans for the future will never come true
<br>Making believe what else can I do?
</verse>
<p> 
<verse>
Making believe I'll spend my lifetime
<br>Loving you and making believe
</verse>
