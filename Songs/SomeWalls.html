A     D         E        A
Some walls are made of stone
A     D        E        A
Sometimes we build our own
A     D      E         A
Some walls stand for years
D         D     Esus~     A   A/C#  D  E
And some wash away with tears
A     A      D    E
Some walls Some walls

A     A         E          A
Some walls are lined with gold
A           D           E        A
Where some hearts stay safe and cold
A      D        E        A
Some walls are made of doubt
D       D      Esus~    A  A/C#  D  E
Holding in and keeping out
           
            F#m  F#m      E       A  F#m
If there¡¦s any hope for love at all
      D     E     A  A/C#  D  E
Some walls must fall
      A  A   D    E
Some walls Some walls

A     D          E       A
Some walls are built on pride
A     D        E        A
Some keep the child inside
A     D         E        A
Some walls are made in fear
D             D    Esus~      A  A/C#  D  E
That love let go will disappear

            F#m F#m       E       A  F#m
If there¡¦s any hope for love at all
      D  D   E   A  A/C#  D  A/C#
Some walls must fall

Bm           Bm    D         E        A   A/G#  F#m  F#m
How will you ever know what might be found
  Dsus2/A Dsus2/A  A/C#       A/C#     E  Esus E~
Until you let the walls come tumbling down

            F#m F#m       E      A  F#m
If there¡¦s any hope for love at all
      D           D     E    A  A/C# D  E  A  A/C#  D  E
Some walls, some walls must fall
            F#m  F#m      E       A
If there¡¦s any hope for love at all
     F#m          D          E    E
Some wall, some walls, some walls
      A    A~
Must fall
