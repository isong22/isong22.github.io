<h2>When I was Young</h2>
<div class="lyrics-body">
<b>Mando - [dist1, growl1] </b>
<p class='verse'>The rooms were so much colder then<br>
My father was a soldier then<br>
And times were very hard<br>
When I was young<br>
When I was young</p><p class='verse'>Smoked my first cigarette at ten<br>
And for girls, I had a bad yen<br>
Life meant so much more<br>
When I was young<br>
When I was young</p><p class='verse'>When I was young, it was more important<br>
Pain more painful, the laughter much louder, yeah<br>
When I was young<br>
When I was young</p><p class='verse'>Don't you know, I met my first love at thirteen?<br>
She was brown, and I was pretty green<br>
I learned so very much<br>
When I was young<br>
When I was young</p><p class='verse'>Love, my love, my love<br>
Love, my love<br>
Love, my love<br>
Yeah, yeah</p><p class='verse'>When I was young, it was more important<br>
Pain more painful, laughter much louder, yeah<br>
When I was young<br>
When I was a baby</p><p class='verse'>My faith was so much stronger then<br>
I believed in my fellow men<br>
I was really so much older then<br>
When I was young<br>
When I was young</p><p class='verse'>When I was a baby, baby, baby, love<br>
When I [Incomprehensible], yeah<br>
Just got to [Incomprehensible] with no shoes<br>
[Incomprehensible], oh love</p><p class='verse'>When I was young<br>
When I was young<br>
When I was young<br>
When I was a baby, baby, baby, oh love<br>
When I was young<br>
When I was young<br>
When I was young, yeah</p>	</div>
