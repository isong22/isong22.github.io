<h2>Long May You Run </h2><div id="lyrics-body">
 <font size="5">
  We've been through some, things together
  <br/>
  With trunks
of memories, still to come
  <br/>
  We found things to do in,  stormy
weather
  <br/>
  Long may you run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chorus ----
  <br/>
  Long may you run.
Long may you run.
  <br/>
  Although these changes have come
  <br/>
  With your
chrome heart shining, in the sun
  <br/>
  Long may you run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Well, it
was back in Blind River in 1962
  <br/>
  When I last saw you alive
  <br/>
  But
we missed that shift, on the long decline
  <br/>
  Long may you
run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chorus ----
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maybe The Beach Boys have, got you
now
  <br/>
  With those waves singing, Caroline No
  <br/>
  Rollin' down that empty , ocean road
  <br/>
  Gettin' to the surf on time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chorus
