<h2>It Stoned Me - G</h2><div id="lyrics-body">
 <p class="verse">
  Half a mile from the county fair, And the rain keep pourin' down
  <br/>
  Me and Billy standin' there, With a silver half a crown
  <br/>
  Hands are full of a fishin' rod, And the tackle on our backs
  <br/>
  We just stood there gettin' wet, With our backs against the fence
  <br/>
  Oh, the water  -  Oh, the water
  <br/>
  Oh, the water  -  Hope it don't rain all day
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Chorus:
  <br/>
  And it stoned me to my soul, Stoned me just like Jelly Roll
  <br/>
  And it stoned me, And it stoned me to my soul
  <br/>
  Stoned me just like goin' home
  <br/>
  And it stoned me
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Then the rain let up and the sun came up
  <br/>
  And we were gettin' dry
  <br/>
  Almost let a pick-up truck nearly pass us by
  <br/>
  So we jumped right in and the driver grinned
  <br/>
  And he dropped us up the road
  <br/>
  We looked at the swim and we jumped right in
  <br/>
  Not to mention fishing poles
  <br/>
  Oh, the water  -  Oh, the water
  <br/>
  Oh, the water  -  Let it run all over me
 </p>
 <p class="verse">
  Chorus
  <br/>
  <p class="verse">
   On the way back home we sang a song
   <br/>
   But our throats were getting dry
   <br/>
   Then we saw the man from across the road
   <br/>
   With the sunshine in his eyes
   <br/>
   Well he lived all alone in his own little home
   <br/>
   With a great big gallon jar
   <br/>
   There were bottles too, one for me and you
   <br/>
   And he said Hey! There you are
   <br/>
   Oh, the water  - Oh, the water
   <br/>
   Oh, the water  -  Get it myself from the mountain stream
  </p>
