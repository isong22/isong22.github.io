<h2>Wheels On Fire</h2>


<p>
<verse><br>
If your memory serves you well, we're going to meet again and wait<br>
So I'm going to unpack all my things and sit before it gets too late<br>
No matter what, we'll come to you with another tale to tell<br>
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well<br>
<br>


Chorus<br>
Wheels on fire, Rolling down the road<br>
Just notify my next of kin, This wheel shall explode<br>
<p>
<verse><br>
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace<br>
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case<br>
If I knew for sure that it was yours, and it was oh so hard to tell<br>
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well<br>


<p>
<verse><br>
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember that you're the one<br>
Who called on them to call on me to get you your favours done<br>
And after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell<br>
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well<br>
