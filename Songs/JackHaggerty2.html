<BR><I>Dan McGinnis</I>

<P>I'm a heartbroken raftsman, from Greenville I came
<BR>All my virtue's departed with a lass I did fain
<BR>From the strong darts of Cupid I've suffered much grief
<BR>And my heart's torn a-sunder, I can get no relief

<P>Of my troubles I'll tell you without much delay
<BR>Of a sweet little lassie my heart stole away
<BR>She's the blacksmith's fair daughter on the Flat River side
<BR>And I've always intended to make her my bride

<P>I work on the river where the white waters roar
<BR>And my name I've engraved on the high rocky shore
<BR>I'm the boy that stands happy on the dark, burling stream
<BR>But my thoughts were on Molly, she haunted my dream

<P>I gave her fine jewels, the finest of lace
<BR>And the costliest muslins, her form to embrace
<BR>I gave her my wages all for to keep safe
<BR>I deprived her of nothing I had on this earth

<P>While I worked on the river, I earned quite a stake
<BR>I was steadfast and steady, and ne’er played the rake
<BR>For Camp Flat and river I’m very well known
<BR>And they call me Jack Haggerty, the pride of the town.

<P>Break></P>

<P>'Til she wrote me a letter which I did receive
<BR>And she said from her promise, herself she'd relieve
<BR>To wed with another she'd a long time delayed
<BR>And the next time I'd see her she'd no more be a maid

<P>To her mother, Jane Tucker, I lay all the blame
<BR>For she caused her leave and go back on my name
<BR>To cast off the riggings that God was to tie
<BR>And to leave me a rambler 'til the day that I die

<P>So come all ye bold raftsmen with hearts stout and true
<BR>Don't trust to a woman 'cause you're beat if you do
<BR>And if you do meet one with a dark chestnut curl
<BR>Remember Jack Haggerty and the Flat River girl!


<P>Notes:

<P>This is, strictly speaking, a 19th century American song. I've always liked it, however, and, having found the following background story couldn't resist. Also, it was written by an Irish-American or an immigrant Irishman. I haven't yet been able to find out Dan McGinnis' birthplace.

<P>From "They Knew Paul Bunyan", by E.C.Beck, 1956:

<P>"Flat River rises in Six Lakes, has a splendid mill-site at
Greenville, and empties into the Grand River near Lowell. It is in what was
a great pine belt of Michigan. A lively incident there is the basis of the
song. When it was composed, Greenville was a small logging town and Anne
Tucker's home was just across the street from her father's blacksmith shop.
In the late [18]sixties big, burly, red-haired Dan McGinnis came to town.
Dan knew Jack Haggerty, a good-looking fellow from Hart and Shelby. Neither
Dan nor Jack was permitted to keep company with pretty Anne Tucker.
McGinnis, a clever entertainer as well as a good raftsman, was assigned to
the camp where George Mercer, Anne's fiance', had been promoted to woods
boss. McGinnis was so aroused that he composed this shanty song, using
Haggerty's name to conceal his own identity. At first Mercer was so angry
that he would not permit the song sung in camp, and the Tuckers disliked
it. In time the family aversion wore away, and Anne herself is said to have
sung it to her Canadian friends."
